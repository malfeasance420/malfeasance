But I do feel like for a strategy that is this tight, it would usually accrue a lot more taker fees?
The biggest noticeable negative so far is the Cardano tx fees
exkoltibur — 6/5/2024 8:56 AM
There is no way to use axo from mobile right? We need eternl or something like that. Its strange basicaöly no cardano app has a mobile app
Wouldnt that help a lot with adoption??

there needs to be a way to speed up the buyback DCA, every 7 hours aint enough - we need to grab as much axo at these prices as we can
Abd121 — 6/5/2024 10:26 AM
And your pay just so happens to be 99% of revenues
Finley — 6/5/2024 10:26 AM
I'm pretty sure it's respective of the amount of ADA in the strategy, so the more ADA available the more frequent the buybacks would be or the larger they would be.
Just need a lot more fees to generate some healthier price action.
dephi — 6/5/2024 10:27 AM
yea we added 1k ada since i looked last yesterday already
Serotonin — 6/5/2024 10:29 AM
Maybe. I’d have to think about it. I’m already stretched pretty thin anyhow with everything I’m doing.
Finley — 6/5/2024 10:30 AM
Yeah idk not mad on the idea of Serotonin taking on any more additional work
He's already doing insane amounts of unpaid work
Suratay — 6/5/2024 10:30 AM
thats the whole point of a DCA, to not interfere with the market based on price actions. The DCA is set for 30 Days with the amount of fees that were available and it will get a new, higher frequency strat as soon as there are more fees next month
Finley — 6/5/2024 10:30 AM
Maybe if he were being compensated for the crazy high quality content, and soon strategies he is making; it's a more plausible idea... but even still it's too much for one man.
dephi — 6/5/2024 10:31 AM
i know the amount is fixed but it used to be 50 ada every hour, now its 100 ada every 7 hours
i too know its to keep the credits used low
but... a man can dream :blink:

Speaking of buybacks... @dannycemilha maybe there is still hope :Prayge:

Suratay — 6/5/2024 10:32 AM
Yes because we collected fees for 4+ month before starting the first DCA. This month we had less ada available thats why its every 7h because higher frewqueny is more fee costs and we cant up the amount baucause there is no ada for it

Lifeless Ditto — 6/5/2024 7:10 PM
Trading bot for the NYSE but he doesn't need to run a server and his orders execute according to the strategy he sets
tailored to allow for HFT if he wants to. And since it is order book, the fees are lower in an order of magnitude to AMMs

eh.
If he is a full time trader, being an orderbook is not an advantage. It is the minimum, he probably doesn't even know what an atrocity an AMM is

Starting to talk about decentralization, non-custodial, smart contracts etc might not be appealing. I would first talk more about the actual trading experience. Algos, strats, xlang, hft. 
Once he's interested, then maybe make him understand you don't need an account, no kyc, assets cannot be frozen etc

Hamilton — 6/6/2024 6:20 AM
It can make harder for people to copy your strategies and you can protect some aplha and it isn't hard
Finley — 6/6/2024 6:20 AM
With enough strategies it would be hard to pick out I'd imagine
The more meta volume Axo generates the harder it would be to parse through I guess
Hamilton — 6/6/2024 6:23 AM
I mean, apparently, it is already something implemented, it is just a case to make it available to the user, doesn't seem to be a huge task, and like I said, it is pseudo private, but at least for someone to look at it, they have to know it is there and if it doesn't show in the front end, it is already a step
And just to add to my argument, why I think even tho, it is not true private, I still think it is worth it, I will quote someone out of context, but it works anyway.

Yo the argument was said in lenfi discord that axo is only offering an api for tt and they need to be able to verify on chain. What's the argument against this?
dephi — 6/6/2024 8:53 AM
axo trades are literally on the L1 they could go and verify on the $axo.fee wallet 
this is what it looks like on cardano scan if you open $axo.fee

thats how my no dev brain would verify the trade....
unsure if thats whats needed but the first market trade in ada/agix OB should be the one in the fee wallet

Marked Safe From Titan — 6/6/2024 8:55 AM
So every trade goes thru that wallet since every fee does?
dephi — 6/6/2024 8:56 AM
the fee s get send to the fee wallet within the same tx that your crypto exchanges in the UTXO (thats how i understand seeing the fee wallet tx, because i always find the same numbers in the OB on axo)
there is no batcher sandwhiching my trades as in AMM Batcher system - there you can trust someone with all of this
[this is just my non team expertise opinion, not guarateed thruth] thats how my brain deals with watching the fee wallet for a while, maybe jarek can confirm/deny later
Finley — 6/6/2024 8:57 AM
I think its because of the policies
every exchange and dapp can be tracked through 1 or 2 policies iirc

I'm not sure how constructive this will be, but if it helps, I'd like to express my feelings—similar to what NobAdy did a few weeks ago—regarding the current status of Axo. If this isn't helpful, I apologize for taking up your time.

Volume is picking up, TapTools integration will be beneficial, the tokenomics are sound, and the team is listening to the community and actively working on improvements. The additions of Thor and Monad have been great.

However, I am not satisfied with the current state of Axo. Perhaps it's my fault for setting my expectations too high before the launch six months ago. Given that AMM models are stupid and Axo's proposition is nearly perfect, I expected Axo to dominate Cardano quickly.

Instead, we experienced a failed launch of an unfinished product. Six months have passed, and it feels like we are still in the same position (even though I know we are not) because people don't know how to use the protocol. By the way, thank you, Serotonin; your threads are great.

I guess I just want to bring awareness to the current situation, which, in my opinion, is not good. I know several people who got burned using Axo. Even though they knew what they were doing (or at least the risks they were assuming), I feel we can't allow this to happen anymore.

I hope this is just a "bottom signal" message, that UX improves from now on, and in some weeks we see a 10x increase in volume (Minswap's current volume). Like NobAdy, I believe in Axo and its team. I just want Axo to succeed because I know it can.

out of 71 trades 5 were takers
so either the logic just doesnt work
or there's rare scenarios where the assert happens and then an order is placed by a 3rd party
forcing me into taker
also because of the assert logic i think? the Cardano tx fees are expensive

Image
I told Matt from Mehen that it would be integrated within the next few weeks when you told me it was but a week away
Axo is the PERFECT home for stablecoin trading, and that is not including the usage of the LONG AWAITED price oracle feed.
Are we going to start disregarding promises and deadlines made in the past AGAIN to franticly pursue new lines of development? 
This is such a tiring game you play with us Jarek. Constantly. and I do mean CONSTANTLY making promises and ETAs and deadlines and giving us hope and expectations over, and over, and over. Yet here we are 6 months post-launch and the platform is barely 2% more useable than it was at launch. When will you stop bullshitting us for a living Jarek?
Finley — 6/9/2024 6:00 AM
So can you explain how you gave a deadline over 2 months ago and we are seemingly nowhere closer to it being met now than we were back then? What sort of disconnect is there between you and the devs for you to feel confident in saying that feature would be ready by Easter yet here we are over 2 months later with nothing to show, and this is just an example of the LONG list of promises you have given not just the entire community, but the OGs in here; I would go as far as to wager that every single deadline you've ever given has not been met.
Why is this?
Don't you think it's time for you to stop making false promises to people?
I think you will find that we are all x10 more disappointed and upset when you give us a deadline and then miss it in catastrophic fashion, as opposed to just saying nothing.
If you have nothing to show for a month, then say that. Don't lie to us and trick us into thinking that new features are "just around the corner", "next week", "soon", that is BULLSHIT Jarek. So no it is not unfair at all to call it what it is. If you lie to us then you are bullshitting us that is the simple fact of the matter. And if you say that is unfair then I say you need to stop pulling these fantasy deadlines and ETAs out of nowhere and giving everybody a false sense of expectation.
Finley — 6/9/2024 7:25 AM
"CMC feed is integrated" you said this weeks if not over a month ago as well so it really means quite little at this point like most things you say which is my actual main point that you haven't addressed. Can you show me the wild assumptions? I asked you why you give deadlines that are never ever met or even close to it; point out the wild assumption in that objective statement please. This is one of a long list of examples that we have all had to deal with and a lot of OGs have simply left or are at breaking point from having do deal with this constant let down and disappointment from you; not the team. The team are incredibly hard workers I have no doubt about that, but it's you who is saying things and making statements that are wildly untrue and are NEVER ever met. 

So I don't appreciate "that is unfair" or "I'm sorry our best is so bad for you" how about a little bit of accountability for your actions and statements as CEO? How about you admit that you have a tedious habit of making statements and deadlines and ETAs that have gone unmet and quite frankly were never going to be met in the first place. It is time you changed some of your habits Jarek before you lose what little remaining diehard followers you have. I do not speak alone when I say these things and you should know a lot of people feel this way; they just wont say it to your face like I am now.
exkoltibur — 6/9/2024 7:35 AM
Why are you guys impacted so much by axo progress? How does it hurt you if progress if slower than expected?
Finley — 6/9/2024 7:37 AM
The speed of progress is entirely irrelevant, it is explicitly the never-ending list of seemingly "objective" statements, deadlines, ETAs, promises and more that have all gone entirely missed and unmet, it is disingenuous and extremely demoralising for those who actually listen and give any weight to the words being said by him.
As I said if you have to pick between making statements that are factually untrue, or saying nothing; why would you pick the former?
Hamilton — 6/9/2024 7:45 AM
I'm not in the mood for discussions today, but this right here is a misinterpretation of the sentiment I feel by talking to some people. I'm a developer myself and I understand that things take time. But as you can see for some weeks now (at office hours for example), I'm asking for no more ETAs, cause they're never met. And it is honestly just misleading. Like, don't know when it will be ready? good. Say it is working progress, but don't play with people's expectations.
Second and no less important, I have PTSD every time I see something new said/announced, cause we still don't have PnL and proper docs and now we see the launchpad thing. Don't get me wrong, I can literally see progress. Volume is picking up due to tighter strategies, I know the team is working on other things like front end fixes and such, even PnL. But looks at it in the eyes of the user, what can I do? AXO is great for people who just want to buy and sell like in AMMs, but what if we want to something more? Everything that was advertised on the whitepaper, interviews and so on for so much time? We can't. I'm just sitting on my hands for some time watching. Cause I can't do what I want to do and every week, there is a new "next week" that never gets respect and it is honestly frustrating. I still have faith in AXO, it is the only crypto position I still hold, I moved everything else back to tradFI. But the current state is worse than what I expected it would be when it launched 6 months ago. ready when ready
baba — 6/9/2024 9:45 AM
I will just add. Its frustrating both ends, team as well as community as the expections are not met. But we all are agreeing, the progress is being made. 

Its just a time where somebody cant hold onto frustration compared to other. We will meet expectations one day! Lets be together !

Idk, I don't really have time to analyze everything rn, so I haven't tried to figure it out
a quick glance on SUNDAE, they were trading ~8-10kADA worth and made like 15% every 2 trades, with maybe 8-10 pairs of trades. Is that like 12k ADA on that pair alone?
looks like they made closer to 30% per pair on rsERG

I've sent this to the team on slack 👍 thanks serotonin 🙏
Oli — 6/10/2024 5:28 AM
Hey everyone, would like to thank Finley, Serotonin and Hamilton for raising this issue with us 

Just to let you know that Jarek also noticed this and could pull some of the strats on time. We're already working on solutions to avoid this 💪
Finley — 6/10/2024 5:33 AM
He noticed before or after multiple CNTs were being arbed for hundreds of thousands of ADA and me and other community members actually said something about it? For anybody that doesn't understand what happened let me explain it for you.
Finley — 6/10/2024 5:55 AM
When the 'ref_spot_all!' signal was released it came with a number of pre-built default returns that could be called from it, mainly there was a 'raw_spot' and a 'smooth_spot' signal to be referenced. These two signals work very differently from one another and although it is obvious from the name its worth understanding what the signals actually do.

The 'smooth_spot' signal returns a smoothed price across all DEX over a recent time-period average.

The 'raw_spot' signal is a very dangerous signal to use in any capacity, this signal will return the most recent price for an asset across ANY market, ANY pool, ANY condition.

And so last night or even 2 or 3 days ago now potentially, somebody realised how flimsy and easily manipulated the 'raw_spot' signal is, so what they did is they found the SUNDAE pool on Minswap with barely any TVL, an empty shallow pool. And then sold 500 ADA of SUNDAE into that pool which caused a significant price movement for SUNDAE on Minswap; what did our 'raw_spot' treasury strategies do? They sold 20k ADA worth of SUNDAE at the price (0.0175) that SUNDAE was being sold for in the empty Minswap pool. And then the same person would buy back 500-1k ADA worth of SUNDAE on Minswap and what would the treasury 'raw_spot' strategies do? Well they would of course start buying SUNDAE at the price (0.019) quoted in the empty Minswap pool.

So now we come to ask ourselves... Why was the treasury placing upwards of 1-2M ADA worth of assets into exclusively 'raw_spot' reference strategies? Who made this decision? Knowing full well that we have 'raw_spot' and 'smooth_spot' calls available and also knowing full well that the 'raw_spot' reference returns the last price under any condition regardless of pool size, volume, or any kind of averaged equation.
Who let this happen? Who made the decision to utilise 'raw_spot' knowing how dangerous it is and how trivially easy it is to manipulate?

How much money did we lose here, will we even be able to tell for certain? Can we go across all pairs and make sure the same hasn't happened?
Because it seems like nobody noticed this happening until myself and some OGs did last night, what would have been if we didn't notice after 2/3 days already?
How much time would it have taken for somebody to milk the treasury dry on every single pair?
Finley — 6/10/2024 5:59 AM
If you notice in the last screenshot here, this CNT was being milked up until just a half hour ago.
Let's try for some accountability for a second day in a row shall we?
Or are my statements once again "unfair" and therefore to be ignored and discarded like usual.
Faketoshi — 6/10/2024 6:09 AM
Did they also gain AXO rewards for being the maker? This is a lot of volume to get rewards for🤔
Finley — 6/10/2024 6:10 AM
Yes they did, they placed limit orders before manipulating the flimsy 'raw_spot' signal which caused the treasury strats to move into their limit orders.

Why are you so angry??? You are acting like you are their boss? What do they owe you? Im sure they don't make mistakes on purpose
Finley — 6/10/2024 8:50 AM
Sorry if you just woke up after 6 months but this has been our reality for half a year now, thats why I'm angry. You clearly haven't paid the slightest bit of attention to ANYTHING that has happened since launch and it really shows.
Please don't try and belittle me for asking genuine questions as to why the treasury is donating tens of thousands of ADA every week to the community.
Come to think of it maybe I just found the person who is taking advantage of these pathetic strategies :sus_eyes:
dephi — 6/10/2024 8:52 AM

i'm glad that ppl like finley are following those moves - end of the day its our treasury, dont wanna have it drained

You should take your share while the exploit is still available, you found it fair and square

Just how detached to reality are you?
Finley — 6/10/2024 8:54 AM
Okay sorry this guy is not being serious he is justifying the treasury turning into a charity
He might actually be the person who found this vulnerability and is milking it :kekw~2:
exkoltibur — 6/10/2024 8:54 AM
Guys I'm gonna say one thing. If you bought axo and you are down then there is absolutely nobody to blame for it but yourselves. That is the only reason I imagine people could get so worked up about this stuff
Finley — 6/10/2024 8:54 AM
How insanely irrelevant

Nah, that is it for me, this guy is delusional

Finley — 6/10/2024 8:55 AM
You seem quite open to the idea of it being a minor issue and no big deal
Do you realise what is happening?
How many tens of thousands of ADA is being generously donated due entirely to incompetence?
exkoltibur — 6/10/2024 8:56 AM
My life does not depend on axo, so that is why I am relaxed
And your life too should not depend on it
TStorms — 6/10/2024 8:56 AM
Why get upset about this? This seems like it’s in line your perspective of the team over the past 6 months. You did what you could for the team by mentioning it. Just take your share of the exploit and move on
exkoltibur — 6/10/2024 8:56 AM
And if it does there is something wrong
Finley — 6/10/2024 8:56 AM
Ah that's nice maybe you should disappear for another 6 months and see the state of the platform then.
Definitely got a long runway ahead.

exkoltibur — 6/10/2024 8:57 AM
Why the he'll are you guys so extremely upset then??? How is your life affected????
I don't get it
I don't get the extreme anger
It must affect you personally somehow
Otherwise where does the emotion come from???
Finley — 6/10/2024 8:59 AM
Why did you put all of the treasury allocation into raw_spot strategies when you knew they referenced the last price across all pools?
And why are there still pairs being manipulated
as recently as 10 minutes ago
All of the treasury is using raw_spot signals
As I mentioned above OPT was being manipulated up until very recently
If a strategy is using the raw_spot reference it is vulnerable to manipulation
So are you going to wait until after somebody discovers an easily exploitable pair to take the strategy down
or are you going to be proactive and take them all down.
Also the point it got so heated was when you tried to brush off my comments as "unfair" and of very little meaning to you, but that's nothing new you should just expect pushback from people when you say those things to them.
All pairs have the ability to be low liquidity
Anybody can make a pool on Minswap or Sundae
Are you going to continue using the very dangerous raw_spot signals or are you going to switch over to smooth_spot?
How much has the treasury lost from these reckless strategies?
Finley — 6/10/2024 9:06 AM
So you decided to use the raw_spot signal for testing purposes, on mainnet with all of the treasury funds?
Did you know smooth_spot existed?
And did you know exactly how dangerous raw_spot is?
How much money did the treasury lose?
Do you take full accountability for those losses? And for using the raw_spot signal knowing how dangerous and easily manipulated it is?
relent7ess — 6/10/2024 9:07 AM
wen aggregator integration
Finley — 6/10/2024 9:08 AM
Will you take accountability for your actions?
And the losses sustained, as well as using the raw_spot signal knowing how dangerous and easily manipulated it is?
Will you also take accountability for what you didn't actually ever address properly yesterday?
I don't feel you are treating us fairly Jarek, that's why I waited 6 months to make it known.
Everything is always "unfair" when it doesn't go your way, isn't that right? Or when anybody has something critical to say or says something you disagree with, that's quite "unfair" as well is it?
pibe age — 6/10/2024 9:22 AM
I just wanted to say, I endorse Finley's comments and stand by them as if they were my own. Jarek, in crypto -especially in the early stages like this- trust is everything. We are here because we trust you and have confidence in your work. Please try to be more transparent and take accountability when it is due. Playing the 'unfair card' does not lead anywhere. We are in this together, trying to make Axo better :malheart:
Finley — 6/10/2024 9:22 AM
When you tell somebody "I'm sorry you feel that way", do you know what that means? It means you're not really sorry and you're also not actually taking any accountability for your actions, saying "I'm sorry you feel that way" is a very subtle way to dismiss and disregard somebody or what they have said. Are you sorry for your actions that you took that incurred the losses sustained by the treasury? Are you sorry for using the raw_spot signal while you knew how dangerous it was? Are you sorry for the never-ending list of missed promises, expectations, and statements? Will you take any accountability for any of it? I'm not interested in "me and the team" because it is you who says and does these things not the team. The team are incredibly hard workers and I have no doubt they are constantly overworked and pushed to their limits. But they didn't do all of these blundering failures did they? They did what you told them to do because you're the boss.
Oli — 6/10/2024 9:33 AM
Guys, there are multiple ways of saying things. This is clearly not the right way, I think everyone can agree on that 😕 while what is being said is true, the way it is said is not constructive at all. It is fueled by emotions and this will lead nowhere. 

Please calm down @Finley and understand that this behavior is not okay. Jarek is here talking to you, take advantage of it. But acting this way only makes it worse
It is creating FUD in this group and that is something we need to avoid 
Finley — 6/10/2024 9:34 AM
Did you or did you not setup the raw_spot treasury strategies? Did you or did you not know that the raw_spot signal is extremely dangerous and easily manipulated? Did you or did you not give a seemingly never-ending list of missed promises, deadlines, ETAs and more? If you did then you should take accountability for those actions.
To be honest Jarek few people care about how "unfair" everything is for you so the weird little condescending ego-trip isn't going to turn many heads for you. The fact of the matter is this is your company and therefore the ultimate burden of responsibility lies upon your shoulders

Sorry people played Chinese whispers for half a year
Enough is enough.
People deserve to know what is happening.
Until we see some accountability and real meaningful acknowledgement of the failures and poor decisions taken, I will persist. If you will not as CEO of this business take accountability for these actions then I don't know who you really expect to do so. Carry on talking about how unfair everything is wont change the current state of events.
No more brushing off responsibilities to others, no more missed deadlines, no more lies and blatant untruths about progress or development. You needed to change your ways a long time ago but the fact you still haven't despite the shitshow that has unfolded since launch is truly impressive yet terrifying to witness.
Hamilton — 6/10/2024 10:33 AM
I agree that the deliver could be different, Finley can have a cunty attitude that a great human being like me, would never.
But please, don't label what he says as FUD when many of us stand behind what he said. The concerns are valid. 
Oli — 6/10/2024 10:40 AM
Many stand by what is being said, but not everyone does. In general, it's not a good idea to shine light on issues on (semi)public channels like the OG channel. These discussions do influence people that might have a different opinion and see things differently. I believe it's important to keep a positive and supportive attitude for everyone in this channel. While opinions vary, everyone needs to ensure our discussions are constructive, especially since the role of OGs is to support the project and team. Many people here remain quiet and I'm sure some of them don't want to read all of this negativity.
Finley — 6/10/2024 10:43 AM
Would you rather I take my thoughts and opinions to a (not)(semi)public channel instead? Sorry but this is the reality of the situation we're in, as I've said already I sat on my hands for 6 months and said nothing. I will remain quiet no longer and everybody in here deserves to know the truth.
I have truly hated these last few weeks and months watching everybody in here and in public tricking ourselves into buying the lies and untruths that we were fed, no more.

Oli — 6/10/2024 10:45 AM
I completely agree about being cautious with giving dates and ETAs. I've learned this lesson the hard way as well 👍 However, some of the comments are approaching a level of disrespect, such as calling Jarek a liar, which is unproductive. People in other channels have been banned for less. While I would never want to stop the conversation here, let's work together to find a solution that satisfies everyone and maintains a respectful and positive dialogue, please
Finley — 6/10/2024 10:45 AM

Nothing changed
Sorry.

Finley — 6/10/2024 10:50 AM
A change in leadership or a means of holding the current leadership to account for his actions. 
I am yet to see any accountability from the sole responsible party for the most recent list of cock ups.
Why were the raw_spot signals used for 1-2M ADA in assets?
Why wasn't it known? Or why was it ignored that these signals are extremely dangerous and very easy to manipulate?
How much money was lost in this failure? And how much has been lost in total from treasury MMs so far?

Finley — 6/10/2024 11:41 AM
I gave two options, the latter of which you're still yet to do. You may not be looking for excuses but it's all you're saying right now. In reality we as community members cannot possibly know what kind of leader you are; can we? Only your team of developers truly knows what sort of leader you are, and we've never heard from them. All we see is a platform that is less functional than it was meant to be at launch; and I certainly don't hold the dev team responsible for that. What do the team think about that? What do they think about the current state of the FE and PnL and signals? What do they think about your leadership and style of management?
Finley — 6/10/2024 11:54 AM
How has the size of the development team changed over time? Since launch? Have you hired new developers or have developers quit? If the team is fully behind you and trusts you and are having work efficiently delegated and assigned to them, why has it taken over half a year for the absolute bare basic aspects of the protocol to be "nearly" functional? And will it take another 6 months for the same quantity of development? Did the FE team support your decision to release the product in its entirely dysfunctional state? Did the BE team support your decision to launch the LSE in its entirely dysfunctional state? I would imagine they take great shame in having incomplete work being presented as their finished product. Did nobody stop to think for a moment about launching this product while the majority of "promised" features and functionality were completely unusable and remain very close to that now, you know like the owner and CEO of the project?
Finley — 6/10/2024 12:12 PM
So by the sounds of it then the recent failures and errors were not made by any of the developers, therefore will you finally take some accountability and responsibility for your actions? And how much money has been lost from your actions? Or all of the missed promises and deadlines that YOU gave people? Or the mistakes with the SPLASH strategies or the BTN strategies when you bought into major slippage on AMMs and then sold at a loss on Axo? I think it's worth restating I have no issue with the team and I have no doubt they are worked to death, but it is ultimately you who the burden of responsibility falls onto when these fatal errors and mistakes occur, so no everything is not just "unfair", that is life Jarek. Life is unfair. Start taking some accountability for your actions and stop bullshitting people with unrealistic, impossible deadlines and ETAs all the time. You've been doing it non-stop for 6 months and despite a lot of us hoping that you would wake up and smell coffee after the disastrous launch; it appears you haven't changed a thing.
Finley — 6/10/2024 12:19 PM
Great thanks for clarifying. There you have it my fellow OGs. Zero accountability for the events we have witnessed unfold over the last few days, and the same for the errors made since launch. I need not say anymore at this point.
This is the reality we are living in guys, and this is why I chose to speak up after months of silence 
Do with this information what you will.
dephi — 6/10/2024 12:29 PM
i just wanna say this: i think its good that we are seeing this discussion
i personally dont really care who's fault it was, but that it gets resolved asap - because if shit doesnt get adressed properly and noone is responsible for failures (which can happen and as long as ppl learn from mistakes they can be good) then people lose trust, some of us are here for almost 3 years, its not that we dont trust jarek to deliver but if OGs and private sale investors start to sell, then thats looking not so well
people lose money & hope and then this thing starts to spiral down. that doesnt help funding, and so on...

so i repair shit for 20 years as job, i'm interested in solutions. what can & needs to be done and adressed?

i have 0 ideas on the MM problems ongoing but i can say what i said from day 1 (as a non coder, bad in math crypto degen user): i need a easy & safe way to provide liquidity ( PnL !) if i hear 3 times "soon™️" and soon doesnt soon soon enough then that sucks - i mean i have to answer people when stuff will come and i already told them next week like 3 times 
exkoltibur — 6/10/2024 12:43 PM
I don't see things so negatively
Volume went up a lot
And there are some custom strats that can be used thanks to e.g. serotonin
I use some myself and even built another one without investing a lot of time
Sp savy people will be able to work with that is there
Ofc we need better docu etc and pnl
But it's not something to get angry about
Axo price rn is totally fine
It started extremely high and is still high
So it's not like there is really a loss of trust there
Axo is still the highest valued dex on cardano by far
Even though it has not the highest volume or tvl
So what's wrong with that??
Oli — 6/10/2024 12:58 PM
AXO is currently ranked number one in capital efficiency, significantly better than other DEXes

In just six months since launch, AXO has also become the number two DEX by volume, even with having only a fraction of the TVL/liquidity. With some fine-tuning and a few more projects adding part of their liquidity to AXO, I believe we can reach the top spot by volume 

Without TapTools integration (hope they won't take too long 😅), it's hard to check the exact figures, but I suspect AXO is also number one in actual profit, even surpassing Minswap, due to Minswap's high token payouts

These are very impressive statistics, achieved in only six months, which does show AXO's rapid progress. While other DEXes have tried to come close to Minswap's volume, we've become nr two in half a year

The PnL backend is ready, so we should see this feature soon. 

Personally, I am in talks with several project leaders who are interested in providing liquidity on AXO. It's important to understand that most liquidity on DEXes comes from the projects themselves rather than regular users. I'm actively involved in trying to bring 10-20% of some projects' liquidity to AXO 👌 

I'm sure I'm missing some, but there are many positive developments that we should celebrate 🎉

Hamilton — 6/10/2024 1:02 PM
I mean, I am here cause AXO sold the idea of being different. Being professional, being a platform for traders, but what can I do as the user that I can't do in a AMM?
Oli — 6/10/2024 1:03 PM
You can use CEX-like trading features, but in a trustless and self-custody manner. Just that is already pretty huge. Running strats might not be for everyone if that's the point you're trying to make
Hamilton — 6/10/2024 1:04 PM

You can do a lot now
Just look at serotonins smart grid

Or is that because the UTXOs aren't consolidated?
Hamilton — 6/10/2024 1:30 PM
The binance comparison is just not true. And I am not even talking about  perps or futures. I know that the lack of options and shorting, inhibit a lot what one can do to avoid beta. But that is not even what I am talking about. I believe that we have the bulding blocks to roll out things of the roadmap and it is a matter of time. 

But I really dislike the way strategies and algorithms are promoted like we can go there right now and make wtv we want. Cause it is just no true, as you know, we lack some signals and we lack proper documentation of what we have. 

I am not denying that these take time and care. But promoting that programmable swaps are 100% usable to the public right now it just intellectually dishonest.
baba — 6/10/2024 1:34 PM
I really think its going over the tipping point! 

When we all can chill to previous levels? Using a moment to question everything will lead to nothing! 

We all know the protocol in its stage and all good, and building blocks are out. I dont know what are we achieving going really into skin! 

I agree with you on handling of treasury in more constructive way. I also hear Jarek which may seem excuse but valid points regarding cardanos low liquidity issues. 

When can we behave more gentlemen and leave it to silence now??
baba — 6/10/2024 1:37 PM
Internally we can say this or that. But what company exist without making marketing UNrealistic? Look at the hopium being sold anywhere else. Speed for splash, decentralization for GY. Not to say, OB for splash, GY, muesli

I see no outcome out  of it, but just burnt hearts

the original market making strats were unfortunate bc they burned some people
they werent really usable as there was no protecteion against gaming the OB
but now with some custom strats emerging its a completely different thing
Oli — 6/12/2024 4:59 AM

Market making is a business where one strategy comes out and destroy another strategy to gain $$

Oli — 6/12/2024 1:20 PM
I'm still waiting on approval for the summary of the office hours, I think the team wants to add some stuff

But to add to what baba says, yes many MMers want to keep their winning strategies private. The team is checking how to add a feature to hide the strategy you're making from the front-end 👍 so that copying is much harder (you'll have to check stuff on chain but not many ppl will know how) 
baba — 6/12/2024 1:20 PM

I am saying, hiding shud be good. Somethjng like somebody minted strategy on chain! 

Now , its hidden and all we see users its performance to copy it! And pay subscription as rewards to MM maintains their private strategy.
Public strategies will not influence someone to keep market making
Oli — 6/12/2024 1:22 PM

Serotonin — 6/12/2024 1:41 PM
I’m a big fan of the grid strats. If you pick a good range you can get some great APR. You have to manually pull them as there is no stop-loss or take profit if they go out of range, but while they’re in range they typically do really well. I’ve had some big wins on the reference strats but also some big losses from them buying high selling low. All around I’m more neutral on them and only expect to be in profit from Axo rewards.
I’ll probably make an easier to deploy Dumb Grid/Grid MM variant soonish that has a stop loss while still not costing credits to update like the Rolling Grid does. Rolling Grid still seems to do pretty well with a high enough spread though
sbjuice — 6/12/2024 1:56 PM
Yeah all mine buy high sell low. Those ntx strats just bleed. I think not giving pnl on atrats was a good thing cause I'm willing to bet most are at a loss.
relent7ess — 6/12/2024 2:00 PM

@HoboHarry4 @thabit187 @serotonin_ada @TapTools @axotrade Don't be kidding yourself that TT can count wallets interacting with another address/contract.

I am not super technical, but DH is also getting the data directly from the OB/market depth + with some of our APIs on top
I'm not involved at all with the taptools discussions, but from what I've seen we did our part and are waiting on them
for the volume, not sure how they can poll it directly on chain 

the fees can be polled from the fee wallet 

But I wouldn't be able to give you more than this right now
Marked Safe From Titan — 6/13/2024 4:36 AM
Feels like a standoff then. They want more on chain looks and axo wants them to just use what they gave

How about we make a trading competition on axo
Nice wash trading for my strats to eat
Or a strategy building competition
Like a hackathon
Things like that could bring some big attention
Also still think the market making dao is a great idea
If we raise like a million dollars with token sale and out it straight into mm
Hmm I see
Ofc it's all a lot of extra work too

i'm seriously starting to believe that TT is getting their data from the wallet provider - that number would make sense if they had counted just ppl sending crypto to receiving adress (or handle $axo.fee) and they would only count that as TX
.. as in: do  they even UTXO 🤔

FUD by taptools. Feels bad man lol
dephi — 6/13/2024 8:04 AM
just speculation on my side, but i dont know what was worse: if it was bad intentions or if it was pure incompetence - how can people honestly think its only 58 wallets interacting with the fucking fee wallet
like just open 50 different tx in the fee wallet - you'll get 48 different wallets 
but no: TT is showing only 58 wallets interacted within 6 FUCKING MONTH

baba — 6/13/2024 11:27 AM
In normal terms what comes out of it is, their architecture need to be modified to support CIP-20 standards for reading transaction metadata. But looks they havent done that, and slow to do that. 

What they are doing instead is poor man data mining, which is reading script addresses and crunching data on their own, and not following standard set by CIP-20 which might be very generic and follow standard across cardano
So using old way wud incur lot of computation and data crunching to support AXo, bcoz typically each order is its own script address, so they need to associate each script address appear on chain with AXo and rollup the numbers to agreegate, means lots of code to write as a poor man data miner
Its interesting to me that AXo is actually overhauling the design specifications to really almost all apps on cardano, by being competitor to some OR by being aggregator to some. But instead of looking bright side, people are engaged in throwing dirt at each other. Like the guy dubbleau from twitter speaking non sense

Oli — 6/17/2024 12:49 AM
It wouldn't change a thing.

Algorand has native usdc and it didn't do anything for their eco system

People still had to mint it but no one did
It did not bring in any liquidity
And now they're stuck with usdc and no one is working on a better alternative

What we have in cardano is imo better. More choice, better choices. And technically usdc/usdt can be brought through wanchain and MyUSD, though through a middle man. But no one is bringing it in, so I don't see why anyone would with native usdc

We have a user problem not a stable problem imo

Wow i saw the first strat that worked most of the day now also stopped producing vob. So you are saying they both ran out of memory? And it seems addition is less of a problem. My v1 strat was doing more addition than multiplication and didn't have issues so it could really be that. Crazy the things one has to work with on block chain

Mobile is live and kicking 👍  can you try to clean the cache/local storage? If that doesn't work, can you share a screenshot of the error?
Try in incognito mode maybe, there's not cache/local storage there, just to see if that works
Maybe you are on an extremely small phone with a very small screen? What's the brand and model? It could be that some smaller phones are not supported, not sure

Lets be honest, splash hasn't worked since launch. Every time a new token came out and had its LP on splash, the whole platform crashed.

Oli — 6/25/2024 5:02 AM
It's really only for batchers
From the team: 
The staking validator trick is useful for batchers which basically have to invoke the same logic n times for each batched tx.
Staking validator trick allows to run a common logic once which drastically reduces ex units and increases the maximum size of batch. However this is not really applicable to programmable swap design
Serotonin — 6/25/2024 8:07 AM

Time to sit back and strategise on MM role. MM shud be able to offset losses some way to get involved into tighter spreads. That wud make volume pick up
Any wild ideas?
dephi — 6/27/2024 1:44 PM
treasury ran tight spread MM strats resulting in losses - but during that time we had really nice trading volume - DH routed lot more trades through axo - we were on second place on daily trading vol for long time
but they didnt show the right numbers :mc:
in fact they showed absolutely wrong numbers - so fuck them still
baba — 6/27/2024 1:47 PM
Wild idea - just like treasury, can we form a cult with multisig wallet, where a bright person like @Serotonin manage MM through it. And we share losses and profits out of it? Until we grow big?
Faketoshi — 6/27/2024 1:48 PM
So, you are saying that TT now integrated AXO?
and that they waited for the treasury to no longer MM (does it?) to display a more undesirable statistic about the overall volume?

I wud want this feature to be inplemented on AXO, so that strategies are hidden but funds can be contributed. Strategy owner charge some extra fee

The math is “simple enough” to calculate everything from the asset allocations using just addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
It’s not the concentrated liquidity variant I wanted, but it’s a starting point.

Are there any drawbacks compares to a "real" cpamm?
Serotonin — 6/30/2024 11:02 AM
It is discrete orders vs continuous and it isn’t pooled. This makes it slightly more “all or nothing” but I think the ability to set your own fee can outweigh this.
The minimum order size makes it not very useful for small “LPers” 
That and it’s more expensive for buyers because they have to pay txn fees for each individual vs a single pool
Serotonin — 6/30/2024 11:16 AM
Also, there is no way to suggest to the user “this amount is a 50-50 valuation” so they have to manually calculate that

yea marketing campaign on PnL / Reward structure launch
because i think after rewards announced we will tank more - and people showing off their profitable strats on top of the AXO rewards (maybe inctivised with following their strats) will mitigate some of the risk of further token dumping 
this is what sets us apart from every single other dex in the ecosystem - if these things were out & a proper marketing strat build around it...

Philippe Le Long — 7/1/2024 8:50 AM
I couldn't find anything in the strategy itself. Slippage is set indirectly by lowering the limit price accordingly.

Philippe Le Long — 7/1/2024 9:46 AM
Any conclusions?
Faketoshi — 7/1/2024 9:48 AM
This is a smart market order and not a limit order imho
So it has to execute at spot price
Serotonin — 7/1/2024 9:50 AM
It’s the “smart market” limit that is used on the basic front end which is a limit order. The logic is exactly the same as the “Limit” order that you place in the Pro interface. It’s just left->right at $price 
It looks like a “Limit” order just has an extra “Computed” variable that helps the interface display the minimum received
Serotonin — 7/1/2024 9:51 AM
Nothing other than it seemed really concerning, given that it goes against how I thought the OME worked.
I thought that it was impossible for the OME to pair transactions that didn’t meet the RFT specifications. If this can happen then that kind of suggests that it really is more of just a batcher to me.
Oli — 7/1/2024 9:52 AM
Seems a different price was sent to us by DH when creating the order and after submitting the order

But still investigating
The actual backend price is 2.6
Serotonin — 7/1/2024 9:53 AM
So it’s a front end display bug that says it’s 1.15 in the strategy?
If you copy the strategy, those same default values automatically fill, so it doesn’t seem to be just a front end display thing
Oli — 7/1/2024 9:56 AM
Seems to be like it but will confirm soon
Need to check exactly what happened
Don't want to put the blame on DH before being 100% sure

44126/16777216*1000= 2.63, so afaik it matches
Philippe Le Long — 7/1/2024 11:07 AM
huh, seems like I just can't operate a calculatro correctly
Neither can the axo frontend though as it seems 😄
Serotonin — 7/1/2024 11:08 AM
I remember DH had the slippage definition discrepancy that caused a bug previously. It might be the same thing here
Philippe Le Long — 7/1/2024 11:08 AM
What is the first integer in the numerator?
Serotonin — 7/1/2024 11:08 AM
I don’t know if it’s a price * (1+slippage) vs price / (1-slippage) definition thing
That’s just my best guess
Well, that still doesn’t get from 1.15 to 2.63
Yeah idk
Philippe Le Long — 7/1/2024 11:12 AM
That's what's strange to me. Both of the orders show the correct limit price in the frontend and in the composer
"correct" as in what the user intended
Philippe Le Long — 7/1/2024 11:14 AM
The smart order itself is just a regular limit order. The frontend will set the limit price based on current price minus specified slippage.
Serotonin — 7/1/2024 11:18 AM
Yeah, but the order was submitted by DH, so I don’t know what they input as the price there (I assume based on their definition of slippage) and how their definition differs
Serotonin — 7/1/2024 12:32 PM
Hmm, then that’s something that I need to add to ⁠No Access I thought that, at least the minted strategies, were visible to everyone there. Since this isn’t the case, there really isn’t any way for people to explore the available strategies. You have to hear about them word of mouth and then search for them in the (broken/limited search) Strategies page 
I assume there will be some way on the future to publish/advertise your strategies there alongside the Axo teams strategies?
Oli — 7/1/2024 12:44 PM
Yes indeed, I think the algo page needs to manually be updated.

With pnl + filter options on the strategies page, it will already be clearer but pls post your suggestion in the suggestion channel 👍
Oli — 7/1/2024 12:45 PM
That's how I envision it, after being vetted by the team
Philippe Le Long — 7/1/2024 1:39 PM
Let's see. Something's definitely off, even if DH created the strategy with the wrong parameters, it should still show the price from the datum in the strategy viewer. Gotta be careful how this issue will be perceived to make sure axo doesn't get unfairly blamed.
Gynopedie — 7/1/2024 2:18 PM
There is a 44k sell order in the orderbook that keep moving, some times disappears or splits in two and change price again between 2.80 and 2.96.  Is this a strat?  Or someone just shuffling a limit order around?

Hey guys, quick update on the limit order issue: it's an issue on DH side and we provided them all the info on how to fix it 👍 
Philippe Le Long — 7/2/2024 10:23 AM
Thanks for the update. Can you elaborate why the wrong limit price is shown in the sxo UI when viewing the strategy?
Oli — 7/2/2024 10:28 AM
It's because behind the hood a smart market order is a limit order with a baked in slippage of 2%. So technically you can enter whatever limit price you want. But because it's a smart market order and not an actual limit order, this limit price is ignored. DH had to make an actual limit order and not a smart market order for the limit price to be taken into consideration.
Philippe Le Long — 7/2/2024 10:31 AM
Is this hardcoded somewhere behind the scenes? When inspecting the underlying xlang algo, it looks to me like the smart market order is basically a regular limit order.
Why even have the option of entering a limit price if it doesn't do anything?
Oli — 7/2/2024 10:32 AM
You don't have the option to do that, DH is just using some special order submission
They just didn't configure it correctly and used smart market instead of limit order
Oli — 7/2/2024 10:33 AM
No idea, maybe it's on OME level, I'm not enough knowledgeable about these things
But either way, we shouldn't get too technical, it's not something a regular user can do anyway
Once it's fixed, it won't happen again, just wish they did some manual QA for this
Philippe Le Long — 7/2/2024 10:35 AM
In the composer it looks like a limit order.
Image
Philippe Le Long — 7/2/2024 10:35 AM
I love getting technical though 😄
I still have a few items on my list to ask Jarek  that he didn't want to spoil before the launch 😉
Oli — 7/2/2024 10:37 AM
There is a difference, not sure how though
It's a limit order 2% above spot, so you get best price up to 2% and if not filled, order closes 
Philippe Le Long — 7/2/2024 10:46 AM
Appreciate your responses!
Philippe Le Long — 7/2/2024 10:50 AM
Hmm,  it seems like axo doesn't entirely work like I thought it did. Viewing the underlying algo of a strategy should normally reveal exactly how that strategy works. I might be missing sth. though, @Serotonin is our xlang specialist
Hamilton — 7/2/2024 12:11 PM
"Basic mode = smart market (safer and works like limit order with a price that crosses slightly ask price)." - Jarek
Serotonin — 7/2/2024 12:17 PM
I would think this is the case, but I think minpwr? was able to import a strategy from a json a while back (they might have disabled this capability?). I don’t imagine, if that’s the case, that any of the wiring diagram would have automatically populated, so I suspect that there can be some mismatch between what the wiring shows and what the strategy actually does.
That said, when I looked at the smart market strategy it simply posts and order at $price and looks identical to the Limit strategy (because after all, a smart market order is a limit order placed some threshold above/below the spot). I don’t recall seeing anything about slippage in the strategy, so I don’t know where that is set. It also doesn’t answer why the strategy viewer would show a limit price different from what was posted on chain. 
dephi — 7/2/2024 1:15 PM

Turkey annouced Crypto regulations
and they're incrediably liberal
normal things such as mandatory anti fraud and money audits for exchanges, mandatory "keep exchange and customer funds seprate" stuff. but self custudy is protected, "crowdfunding" is legalized

🔥HOTSKY🔥 — 7/3/2024 6:30 PM
Serotonin — 7/3/2024 10:09 PM
It’s a known thing that they are trying to add to the credits history. When I made the strategy I thought that it would update the Eval Variables when a match was made (using the takers fees) but unfortunately it updates those variables from your own credits after the trade has happened. Because of this it will use roughly 0.5 Ada in credits when it updates the grid line
Oli — 7/4/2024 2:31 AM
What Serotonin said 👍 we have a product spec to add these eval update credits

Alright, I've got a strategy that I made per request and I'm trying to figure out which of these it would fall under
Image
I think I'm going to call it a "Staircase Take-Profit"
Basically, you define a starting price, tranche size, and step % and it will sell a tranche at the price and then increase the price by the step % for every next tranche, until the strategy runs out of funds
so, it's essentially one half of the Rolling Grid, but never buys back in
What do you all think? I'm kinda leaning towards "Technical"
It's not really around the spot price, and it tries to always place limit orders so I don't think that's the best
And it's fairly simple, so I don't know if I'd consider it "Advanced"

Not cool.
Oli — 7/7/2024 6:42 AM
I will not allow being disrespectful 👍

I am very relaxed, shit talking is fine, negativity is fine, criticism is fine, just have to remain respectful

Look at my conversation with sbjuice and minpower for an example of a difficult but respectful conversation 👍 
Insults is an insta 3 day mute, that's for sure, that's disrespectful for everyone
There will of course be warnings first, I don't like muting people, even less banning. It's not something that should generally be done. But it's usually the only thing left after multiple warnings

I'm quite leniant when it comes to those things
Faketoshi — 7/7/2024 6:47 AM

That's not something that should be said to anyone, let alone a team member 
Everyone should be respectful to one another on this server, no one likes insults and trolling other people

If warnings don't help, then a mute is warranted
Sammy — 7/7/2024 6:50 AM
that is where context is important, which we now dont have. depending on the discussion a fuck off may be acceptable or not, even if youre a team member 
Faketoshi — 7/7/2024 6:50 AM

Oli — 7/7/2024 6:52 AM
No never. Regardless of the context.

Read the conversation I had in price talk yesterday with sbjuice and minpower. That's how it should be done

If I ask someone to not be disrespectful and to keep it positive, and in response get a fuck off, then you get muted
Oli — 7/7/2024 6:52 AM
It has nothing to do with watching what you say or not to offend anyone.

You cannot not offend anyone, that's not the world we live in

But insults is a no go
Monday everyone will be unmuted. I hope we can continue with staying respectful
Again, take an example of sbjuice, minpower, and the conversation were having right now.

This is perfectly fine
Sammy — 7/7/2024 6:54 AM
No never. Regardless of the context.

That is your opinion and youre the the mod now . Thats all there is to it
Oli — 7/7/2024 6:59 AM
Thanks for the feedback 👍 muting someone for saying fuck off is not about a personal opinion, I need to maintain a respectful environment in the server. Aggressive language like that goes against principles of staying respectful. We need to allow anyone to have civil and open discussions and a fuck off has no place in this. It's nothing personal

They will be unmuted on Monday, let's hope everyone can remain respectful to everyone
Sammy — 7/7/2024 7:01 AM
If I ask someone to not be disrespectful and to keep it positive..

Also, "asking"/forcing someone to keep it positive when things are not positive, is a very cynical thing to do. Perfectly understandable if some snap at that point 🙏
Oli — 7/7/2024 7:01 AM
No need to keep it positive, that's not needed. Just keep it civil and respectful
You can be negative all you want, you can give criticism all you want, that's all fine
Being disrespectful is not
Again, look at the conversation I had with sbjuice and minpower. Wasn't the most positive one, but was respectful 
And that's fine
It's not easy staying positive with the token price and some core features not being released yet, that's okay
I get it 
But being disrespectful is not okay
It's also not easy for me staying positive seeing pretty much 1/3 of my crypto wealth being so hard down, so I get the sentiment
Just stay civil is all I'm asking
Sammy — 7/7/2024 7:06 AM
Then dont tell people to keep it positive. Its like telling a person who's furious to "calm down".
Oli — 7/7/2024 7:06 AM
I won't 👍 that's fine
TStorms — 7/7/2024 8:42 AM
This is prob why we’re all a bit surprised @Oli .
We used to be able to tell each other to fuck off regularly because we’d limit it to who we knew was in the server and could ‘take it’, realizing that it wasn’t personal. They probably expected you to fit that profile too since you’ve been here a while and are involved
Looks like we’re going into a more filtered direction which is fine, just letting you know where our surprise came from.

I’d like to add a gfy joke here, but now I’m kind of scared I’d get banned/muted too :malsweat: 

So… go hug yourself :malheart: :malgrin:
Oli — 7/7/2024 8:48 AM
Thank you for your message, it is interesting and puts it in a different perspective which I didn't have before 👍 

OG channel I will be super super lenient, here is different as only a few amount of ppl are in. It's your little place. If you don't want me here, I can even accept that and leave the OG channel 👍
And jokes are totally fine, it depends on context as others have said here. 

On public channels I need to be a bit more strict, I would rather keep it clear from foul language before it turns into just that, people disrespecting each other making it an unpleasant place for the community 
Sammy — 7/7/2024 8:58 AM
That's what was so special about this place (and I mean the whole server), we used what you consider foul language but it never devolved into an unpleasant place. But those seem to be bygone days.
TStorms — 7/7/2024 9:12 AM
This seems like a nice solution (the more lenient for this channel part, not the you leaving part :malgrin: ), thank you

Do anyone uses the stable/stable pair?
on axo
relent7ess — 7/7/2024 7:29 PM
we should probably focus on stables trading and thats the easiest pair to have
Serotonin — 7/7/2024 7:30 PM
Yeah, but I'm not trading iUSD until after the RMR changes and see how much it repegs
relent7ess — 7/7/2024 7:30 PM
i mean djed or usdc as well
the problem is its kind of clunky
Serotonin — 7/7/2024 7:30 PM
DJED, but not USDC, is there any volume on USDC?
relent7ess — 7/7/2024 7:30 PM
to even know that stable/stable is available to trade
99% of the users only know of ada pair and intuitively thats the only thing they look for
relent7ess — 7/7/2024 7:31 PM
There can be lol just figuring out when is the right time to bridge in some
Serotonin — 7/7/2024 7:31 PM
Elder has an arbitrage bot up though, so that takes care of a lot of volume for the stable pairs
relent7ess — 7/7/2024 7:32 PM
nah i don't want to depend on bot fed volume
its useless for bot volume vs organic mindshare
Serotonin — 7/7/2024 7:32 PM
I mean...that's kinda always the case
relent7ess — 7/7/2024 7:32 PM
there is a difference between these
Serotonin — 7/7/2024 7:32 PM
Sure, we want mindshare. I don't see it happening until there is at least 500k USD in a pair to trade
probably closer to 1M per side
relent7ess — 7/7/2024 7:34 PM
i think 50k should be sufficient.
its not a curved afterall
Serotonin — 7/7/2024 7:34 PM
But even then, I mean is there really a "mindshare" to speak of on ETH and other chains? Like, afaik, yes there are a quite a few people trading them, but I assumed that the bulk of the volume originated from the different stables providing different returns/opportunities on various protocols and so there was a necessity to swap between them
relent7ess — 7/7/2024 7:35 PM
sort of because most dexes incorporated v3 uni
so the spread between dexes is minimal
it becomes a compeition to drive the organic demand.
unless u are making that big of a trade
And perhaps its more important for OB
relent7ess — 7/7/2024 7:59 PM
@Serotonin dumb grid is probably enough to start quoting for the pair i guess
Serotonin — 7/7/2024 8:01 PM
Yup, that's the "free" version.
Rolling Grid can make more grid lines (semi-infinite), but costs ~0.5 ADA to update the internal parameters in the RFT each time one grid line sells out and it has to re-draw them. It also has a specific grid layout, whereas you can do any layout you want with the Dumb Grid 
Also, GridMM is probably an easier one to setup than the Dumb Grid
I'm going to try and come back to the Rolling Grid at some point and make some fixes so that it doesn't cost credits all the time. I think it would have to be a linear grid scaling vs logarithmic (percentage) though.
relent7ess — 7/7/2024 9:36 PM
lol still wishing that aggregator is cooked up and default mode is set to simple mode
would also be nice if there is a indicator showing ur limit orders on the orderbook ladder
dephi — 7/8/2024 5:08 AM
anybody know why there are tiny buys in the buyback? 0.37 ada buy, resulting in 0.75credits used doesnt seem to be useful
Image
Oli — 7/8/2024 5:28 AM
I think it has to do because on an order book the matching is done peer 2 peer, matching a buyer directly with a seller. Perhaps at that exact price point, there was only 1 seller (1 strategy) with that amount of funds

Just thinking out loud, I'm not sure
Suratay — 7/8/2024 7:29 AM
But wasn’t it said that matches below 5 ada will not match for that exact reason?
Oli — 7/8/2024 7:45 AM
Maybe total match was 5ada across two different prices, not sure if that makes sense 

Not sure about the exact technalities
So it's 1 seller, but strat moved price just slightly for 1 order above 5ada
Maybe @Serotonin has an idea before I ask the team
Serotonin — 7/8/2024 8:10 AM
No, I don’t know why sometimes orders < 5 Ada are possible to go through. I imagine it’s if there is 2 orders that are matched in the same block and the OME doesn’t have a chance to blank out the portion with < 5 Ada?
Like, I’m pretty sure aggregators are ever so slightly underestimating their sizes on Axo so they don’t end up charging the user more credits for a tiny amount. This leads to a tiny amount being left from someone’s order that might be filled if someone else jumps in quick enough

You can ask me to do things, you can't command me 😅 it's not rocket science

And we literally discussed yesterday how the OG group will be different and I'll allow whatever. This goes also for me 👍

Thats more an advice you should follow first 👍
A simple "would it be possible to unmute me everywhere?" will suffice 
Finley — 7/8/2024 11:11 AM
You'll have to remind me when I went around muting because because they hurt my fragile ego
Sorry fragile bags*

Finley — 7/8/2024 11:18 AM
ok then
lets go back to the cause of this little chat
unmute me
🙂
Sammy — 7/8/2024 11:20 AM
That is how you make a dog beg,  or a child say "pretty please", by holding  something out  of their reach.

I dont know where you grew up but your ideas of what  is unacceptable or what basic decency is not shared by many other people, dont overvalue your views. That part where you have  to  earn respect, I  1000% agree with. So far, youre way underwater
Finley — 7/8/2024 11:20 AM
Of course it's a highly antagonistic thing for him to say
Oli — 7/8/2024 11:21 AM
He can ask, not command 😅
Finley — 7/8/2024 11:21 AM
Almost like he was trying to cause conflict
Oli — 7/8/2024 11:22 AM
I think most would agree 👍

Would be nice to hear other people's opinions
Sammy — 7/8/2024 11:22 AM
well, i didnt see it as a command
Oli — 7/8/2024 11:23 AM
I'm quite reasonable
Finley — 7/8/2024 11:24 AM
See in reality I shouldn't have to ask you to unmute me because you shouldn't have forgotten that you decided to mute me in 3 different chats so you needed to unmute me in all of them
Do your job
drop your fragile ego check it's really embarassing
Sammy — 7/8/2024 11:26 AM
how  is that a response to me above comment
Oli — 7/8/2024 11:26 AM
It's just a statement, I didn't reply to you 
I'm a quite reasonable person, but some things just go too far, I don't understand how you cannot see that 😅
Sammy — 7/8/2024 11:35 AM

I'm with oli in that I don't see what the team did to deserve to be insulted so much...
Finley — 7/8/2024 11:50 AM
This has nothing to do with "the team" it is entirely concerning an incompetent leader and his power trippy discord mod
exkoltibur — 7/8/2024 11:53 AM
I don't really see why you think jarek is incompetent. He built the whole thing... communication is not really good sometimes (incl right now) but that's really not a reason to hate him with a passion
Be honest: is the reason you are so angry with jarek that you lost money with axo token?
🔥HOTSKY🔥 — 7/8/2024 11:56 AM
Finley — 7/8/2024 11:58 AM
If you think this is about "communication" then you're extremely well versed at not paying attention to anything, I've said what the problems are in here before and the moment I uttered them outside of this channel I was muted. I'm not going to repeat myself if you cant be bothered to remember what was said in the past or go and look for yourself.
baba — 7/8/2024 12:30 PM
Whatever youre doing. Its not helping somebody get positive energy out of your criticism but a rant, negativity and even insults. 

You might be right saying it first time. I feel it right. But youre not leaving it, it proves nothing. 

The only point by bringing mute option is for you to make it feel cooled down, and come back and be part of it. But as soon as unmuting is done, you start with same energy as earlier. 

I have to say this after observing your comments from many many days. 

Jarek build this thing. The man can have flaws, the product cant have success. But i do know there is absolutely nobody who can achiever even little to what he has achieved today. 

When it comes to management and development with little finances you have got, you make many mistakes to achieve results in fastest possible manner, in crypto in secured manner as well as youre playing with real funds of others. 

So please calm down. You have said what you have said. Pls dont push more to this, and move on
Finley — 7/8/2024 12:31 PM
I came here to get unmuted and got ego checked
I haven't said a word in here in a month
Finley — 7/8/2024 12:31 PM
This is literally me saying I'm not going to repeat myself and carry on
Serotonin — 7/8/2024 12:48 PM
Jfc can everyone stop acting like teenagers?
Finley: Stop being so insulting and aggressive. I don’t know what exactly you’re trying to achieve, but even if you’re points are completely valid it’s not going to get anyone to rally behind you or change Jarek’s opinion if you’re so coarse and boisterous. You’ll get way further with people if they can empathize with your position and that’s not going to happen the way you’re approaching it.

Oli: Please quit egging him on. I realize you put up with a lot of bullshit in all of the various channels and in your DMs but the older brother power trip “say please” stuff isn’t helping diffuse the situation and you know it. Please try to be the bigger person here.

Jarek: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE listen to your team, TRUST THEM, and don’t try to micromanage them. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good. There’s too much work to be done and most times getting something out is way better than waiting until everything is perfect (docs are a prime example). Most things can be fine tuned later. I hope we can all agree that your time would be better spent working on things like documentation or making sure that LSE strategies can’t be gamed than moderating the intricate details of aesthetics or communications.

Finley — 7/8/2024 12:55 PM
Sorry man I just want to get unmuted :/ I played nice for 4 months slowly finding out what is happening internally and did my part in trying to gently push for meaningful change. That didn't work. The time for gentle pushing and positive reinforcement has long passed by and I spoke up about that many weeks ago now. The ship will sink if our glorious leader wont stop steering it directly into the mother of all icebergs; but I've already accepted that fate based on his actions since launch some 7 months ago now. I convinced the people who I intended to when I made my original stance known and I've no intention to carry on at it. Like I said I'm just here to get unmuted :joeshrug:
Finley — 7/8/2024 1:05 PM
Also I hate to tell you Sero but you are on a long... long... list of people who have politely and respectfully tried to get Jarek to smell the coffee and fix his shit. Of course you are absolutely right I am incredibly aggressive and insulting towards him and his lackey and for that of course I apologise to you and all of the OGs who bare witness but take no pleasure. If the change required to stop this ship sinking is ever to be had, it will be so when the flames have kindled jareks feet to a crisp. But even then his pride and arrogance would never allow such things to happen. 
baba — 7/8/2024 1:08 PM
Great to hear you being a bigger and better person here. @Oli too being a nice guy here to try to school in his way. I am sure you guys can handshake in some eventful day.

Maybe i am not aware. But whats with the information about jarek being so salty? Whats the thing that holding it back for team to deliver?
I can smell that he has tremenduous pressure to make axo succesfull, and i can give him free pass on somethings. But i would be happy to know for info sake
Finley — 7/8/2024 1:12 PM
Again... I'm not here to bring up some of the issues I raised a month ago. I just want to be unmuted 😂 I spoke about it in this channel a few weeks ago now so if you want to find the conservation you are more than free to; unless the discord mod deleted those messages as well as the ones in degencorner.

Oli — 7/8/2024 2:10 PM
Similar to Cardano, but not sure of the details

If you want to read about how badly funds were used, search for "polkadot marketing" on Twitter and read the first few top posts...

Tldr, millions and millions were used on marketing efforts with close to zero return on investments

Some influencers got paid a way too high amount, they spend money on dumb stuff like paying millions for a gif as a token icon on CMC etc...

I see similar things potentially happening on cardano
exkoltibur — 7/8/2024 2:17 PM
These things absolutely must not happen on cardano
If it does, crypto is dead
We really need to fight for that otherwise its all over
Thats why I am very glad we have dreps and ada amount voting which is skewed to whales
If we had 1 Person 1 vote direct voting the treaty would be grifted empty in no time

I didn't use polkadot personally but from what I've heard the main problem was that funds could've better been spent on building out infrastructure and dapps and improve the user experience

Marketing did bring in users, just for them to notice how bad the ecosystem was and how little you could do there. And the things you could do just had bad UX

Yes of course, it's on the list of priorities 👍
But generally, in startups, it's normal to have people join and leave at certain points, hire new people etc. People usually don't stay for years in the same company as they're looking for new challenges and exciting projects to work on
Oli — 7/9/2024 12:23 PM
Just checked official statistics, and official median employee tenure in startups is 2 years

So nothing out of the ordinary for AXO 
I've worked for several startups since 2019, people usually don't stay longer than 2-3 years, doesn't mean the company is doing bad, no need to stress for employees coming and going in startups is what I'm trying to say 👍

Having him answer some questions and concerns needs to be put into the looonnng list of priorities? Come on. The priorities of the project are one of the concerns. I think being transparent and answering some questions is a priority that won't take to much time. Especially for the OGs. Not saying we should get special treatment nor do we want to dog pile but some answers would go a long way. Little AMA action.

Considering the hacking we had to do to get the tokens at 0.0875 and sell back at 0.087499, we won't do this last part

We did fulfill slightly more than 700k DEDI this way, so that's pretty nice

I don't know who needs to hear this, but a Cardano L2 does a presale just days before Dedium and they had to double the amount of tokens per ADA given in the sale and then lower the cap to 500k and promise bonus perks and it still wasn't filled.
The degens in Cardano are milked absolutely dry and Dedium should not launch in this environment (trying to raise 4m+) as the first, shining example of the AXO launch pad.

ofc it is
I just hope that their partners can talk some sense into them. Considering they also lose on a disastrous first launch.

@Oli
Serotonin — 7/11/2024 8:57 PM
@Oli also a question for the next office hours.
How will Axo plan on advertising/displaying rewards for liquidity providers? Like, it’s not as easy as throwing up an APR on a strategy because each strategy has an infinite number of parameters that would yield different “HRA” in Axo.
Oli — 7/12/2024 1:46 AM

How much did AXO lose?
Serotonin — 7/14/2024 6:37 PM
Dunno. I caught it mid way and can’t be bothered to analyze it. Might not be that much lost at all, but still. Just throw up some grid strategies or the AMM equivalent with a small amount of funds so they have to at least work through some limit orders to get to the main LSE strategies. I’d rather the LSE have some IL/IR on a small amount of funds then it going to these people milking them

Which reminds me. I need to fix both the Rolling Grid and the CPMM strat so that they can be used on empty order books. Right now the check for min_ask and max_bid errors out when there isn’t anything returned so they won’t post anything
Serotonin — 7/14/2024 7:57 PM
I mean…everyone’s been talking about it ever since launch with the spread and box top strats. More specifically with LSE funds since they launched too, but it’s been going on since the beginning

Oli — 7/15/2024 10:57 AM
Yes it seems there was some sort of attempt of an attack, but doesn't seem it was successful in "stealing" funds

He appreciates the feedback from serotonin on having more different strats running, he's considering it and will check it out 👍
Serotonin — 7/15/2024 11:18 AM
Good to know that they weren’t able to steal any funds
I actually thought about making a trap strategy that would prey on people trying to milk these strats. If it knew a-priori what the parameters from a “bait” spread MM strat were then it could wait and not post an order until that spread strat started being gamed.

Orders getting filled at wrong price?
Oli — 7/18/2024 6:17 AM
pre-trade orders got filled at wrong price because of how the OME works
the pre-trade orders were makers, and they filled at the order price
once live-trading started, and new orders coming in were takers, these ones did fill at best price, so at 0.0875

about 300 wallets are impacted and will get their missing funds soon
Serotonin — 7/18/2024 9:28 AM
Taptools double counts the volume because the Dedium wallet that's providing funds counts as another p2p trader.
Image
Serotonin — 7/18/2024 11:01 AM
What's going on? Are the market buys going just below the list price?
Image
I assume re-deploying that limit order into a new strategy just below those buys to fill them will mess up the % sold tracker? 
And it looks like there'd be about 1k ADA stuck that wouldnt' get filled at that price
Oli — 7/18/2024 11:10 AM
All fixed 👍
Market orders were created at 0.08749999999 instead of 0.0875

But rounding error fixed and new orders should go through

Pending orders have to be canceled and recreated
Serotonin — 7/18/2024 11:12 AM
The people who put those in probably aren't going to be happy if they can't get their new order in below 0.0925
Do you want to try and just fill the pending orders so they don't have to be canceled?
Like, just manually buy 75.6 kADA worth off the market and then sell it back to fill those pending orders 
Oli — 7/18/2024 11:15 AM
There's still 1M left at 0.0875

If there are issues and people don't get in because of our mistake, then AXO will make them right
We'll leave it as is for now, I'm going offline
I'm kinda on holiday and really want to get away form the stress right now 😅

Serotonin — 7/18/2024 11:17 AM
That's what I'm saying, have AXO use ADA in the treasury to right now just buy the 864k DEDI needed to fill those orders and then sell that DEDI in a limit sell at 0.0874 ADA to fill those pending orders

Either way, I'd still fill that last 12.6k worth of bids. The complaints of people who didn't get filled isn't worth the 700 ADA you'd lose on the trade buying at 0.0925 and selling it back to them at 0.0875

Sorry only saw your message now

Considering the hacking we had to do to get the tokens at 0.0875 and sell back at 0.087499, we won't do this last part

Sold a little under 5k ADA worth of MNT slightly below cost (maybe -1k ADA worst case) to shift the price down and then spent another 12k buying it at less than half value (-12k ADA) to end up with ~24k worth of MNT (+24k ADA)

I might be making it up, but I think I saw a super low limit order at basically 0. I'm assuming that they threw some in there to make it look like the order book had depth. There's over 2 hours in between those orders so it seems like they're targeting pairs that arbitrage bots don't work on
Yeah, the limit order is still there

exkoltibur — 7/21/2024 8:50 AM
How does that work? Who sold a big amount for half price?
Serotonin — 7/21/2024 10:54 AM
The LSE strategy
Basically place orders such that it tricks whatever the strategy sees as the “spot price” whether that be on Axo or in low liquidity pools on other DEX and it will put its liquidity around that price.
exkoltibur — 7/21/2024 3:03 PM
Ok I dont know how that particular strat works. But find it surprising that it buys more than it sold before
So its not symmetricaö
Serotonin — 7/21/2024 8:15 PM
The strategy is the one on the opposite end of those trades. So the person gaming the strategy is the one who sold at 0.258 and then bought back and 0.075 and 0.143. The LSE strategy was the one that lost out by buying at 0.258 and then reselling that same MNT and more at 0.075 and 0.143.
Or maybe I'm reading it wrong and the person didn't even have to sell MNT, they might have just gamed it and only bought.
Either way, the point is that the LSE strategy sold 20-25k ADA worth of MNT at half price or less
Meaning it's out 10-12k ADA
exkoltibur — 7/22/2024 12:01 AM
Oh I get it now

Serotonin — 7/23/2024 3:41 PM
I’d like MMing to be easier. That would definitely help liquidity. I’m just worried that it’s still at a stage that’s too difficult for most people. Like, if this is the type of flak that we get when people don’t even know about MM then boy we will be in for some once they go through the learning curve.
There still aren’t good strategies publicly available for true market makers to reliably deploy tight liquidity. No way to guarantee they won’t be takers and eat it with fees. All of the grid strategies out right now are iceberg strats that don’t leave a ton on the books at once
🔥HOTSKY🔥 — 7/23/2024 3:50 PM

Serotonin — 7/23/2024 5:13 PM
Yea, I’ve requested that they make a flag of some sort. Idk if that would work with the way the OME is written though. I’m placing things outside of the min_ask and max_bid but those always refer to the last block, so if an order comes in the same block as your strategy updates then it’s a toss up as to which is considered “first” to be the maker
Philippe Le Long — 7/23/2024 5:15 PM
Like on Kraken, where you can set your order to post as limit order or sth. like that to ensure you're paying maker fees.
I'm sure it would be possible, albeit not completely trivial.

Don't forget Minswap has many minions over social media being paid to shill minswap and dunk on others 👍 not saying they're that, but they exist
Serotonin — 7/24/2024 9:33 AM
So why has there been no one to help Dedium provide liquidity on Axo? They’re waiting for a response from whoever they went with for a MM (either GSR or Trireme) but I don’t suspect those companies know anything about MM on Axo, so it will be another few days at the bare minimum for them to put anything other than limit orders down. They should have had strategies planned, built, and tested before they even launched. Meanwhile the masses are demanding they put liquidity on AMMs and the first 50k PoL appears to have gone to SundaeSwap.
Oli — 7/24/2024 9:42 AM

4) Who is handling finances of the whole project and whats the health look like finances wise considering work for another 2 years remaining to complete roadmap?
5) Where is @CardanoThor ? 
I am not a person to far cry and scream on failures. But we need empathic and realistic communication going , the first thing is to accept that yes we have been delayed, whatever circumstances were.

Just to let you know, finance-related questions were not answered, and we won't address them as they involve internal information. 
Regarding the question about the load or pressure Jarek is experiencing, I mentioned it's a personal question. But, I can share my personal experience that working in startups, in general, is stressful. I can attest to that working in startups since 2019
baba — 7/25/2024 12:06 PM
Ok. But concern is on the development velocity side. We are seeing delays after suggesting multiple times that “hard work is done, its should be easy to roll out features” and this is becoming endless wait for feature rollouts. Needless to mention, we are loosing competitive advantage with time being so ahead in industry. If features are rolled out, we have enough community members to push for marketing and integration. But we need to have feature completeness
I am ok to be delayed, but communication and transparency is the key in building trust in the situation we are now. Transparency wudnt matter earlier, but it matters now IMO

I didn’t hear all of the community call, but the part I listened to it seems that after the Chang hardfuck it will be impossible to MM if we are little fish, because the fees for MM will be a lot higher. Is that it?
Serotonin — 7/25/2024 9:28 PM
No, I don't think so. Fees are paid by the taker, so if your strategy is always the maker then I don't think it will matter.  All fees on Cardano will go up. But tbh I was kind of in and out so I might have missed something.
Oli — 7/26/2024 1:17 AM
Not sure what you want as an answer on "why are things delayed". If something is delayed it means we worked on something else in the meantime. Focus now is removing pain points of our current platform, releasing performance upgrades, UX/UI improvements and adding the community suggestions. 
Oli — 7/26/2024 1:19 AM
I'm also curious to see how this will develop across the whole eco system.

But since the fees for ref scripts  is something all dapps on cardano will have, everybody suffers from this, especially the user making a swap and paying a higher fee.

Wonder if IOG has something in mind to lower the fees in general and make it more user friendly
Marked Safe From Titan — 7/26/2024 4:35 AM
Makes a lot of sense to raise fees before we on board defi users. Cardano is competing with eth L2s essentially and their fees are pennies. Carbonzo is dead
Oli — 7/26/2024 4:52 AM
Jarek mentioned in the call that IOG would not provide information as to why they did this, unless you sign an NDA and don't talk publicly about it 🤷‍♂️ 

It does seem that AXO will be less affected than other DEXes that use the batcher model, so that's a good thing

I would also argue that ETH L2s concentrated on being cheap and fast, but not decentralized, with the backdoors and admin keys etc. 
Though I also see that most people don't care about that :shrug:
Marked Safe From Titan — 7/26/2024 5:11 AM
The key is users don't care about that
Oli — 7/26/2024 5:12 AM
it's unfortunate, but true 

people don't even care putting their whole life savings in Solana, a chain that is (was?) known to go offline, it's just gambling to get that dopamine hit
Marked Safe From Titan — 7/26/2024 5:15 AM
Other chains are centralized with decentralized apps and cardano chain is decentralized with centralized apps. I usually don't include solana in chain talks
Oli — 7/26/2024 5:22 AM
That's one way to put it yes
dannycemilha — 7/26/2024 6:09 AM
So eventually can we say it could be less fees for MM on Axo after the hardfuck?
Sammy — 7/26/2024 7:06 AM
To be fair, the question was mainly how many are left working, not who left/was let go for what reasons. Those reasons are uninteresting. We are not about gossip here
Abd121 — 7/26/2024 7:52 AM
I suppose a it's better to assume good faith with questions and answer based on that version of them. even if we think the one asking is being malicious, since it'd be addressing everyone in general and clarifying positions as opposed to responding to the attacker specifically.
Sammy — 7/26/2024 8:16 AM
its not only mine, it is what was actually asked and desired to be known. yes, some did phrase it differently and more harshly but not the majority of us. I have only seen Oli and/or you make it about whatever reasons there were for developers to leave. again, reasons are uninteresting and irrelevant

as for the teampage, yes, just as you say, no one cared and would continue to not care about the teampage if you provided information on how many people are left working on your project. 
only after becoming starved for real information did people turn to the teampage and how see how out of date it is, which of course made it worse

this chapter of drama is on you
Marked Safe From Titan — 7/26/2024 9:55 AM
Things investors don't care about; team members are leaving for natural reasons. Things we rightfully care about; team members leaving cause of change of vision or leadership. It's very pertinent to our investment especially given the speed of fixes and road map implementations
Oli — 7/26/2024 10:12 AM
Form what I've seen, no one has left for the reason you mentioned. I explained already the one dev that left recently was because he is a hardcore Haskell dev and wants to do just that. He received an offer for a better position as a team leader of a Haskell dev team.
Definitely good to see people do good in their career
Abd121 — 7/26/2024 10:22 AM
So I suppose this is a confirmation that the current page is correct as of now?
Oli — 7/26/2024 10:23 AM
No it's not correct, once our main FE dev is back we'll have the page updated
Just wanted to shine some light about "people leaving because change of vision and leadership" 
There are also (from what I can see) no employees, but only contractors, which is typical for startups and remote jobs
I haven't worked as an employee in the multiple startups I've been part of. I think it's just too difficult to handle employment, taxes, social security for different countries for worldwide people, just a mess
Abd121 — 7/26/2024 10:27 AM
from what I seeing from this whole "dev leaving discorse" this is what seems to be the catalyst for the questions
I know a lot of the devs who used to do contract work for AXO, people are seeing their contract ends so they're now wondering who is still there and who didn't renew post launch.
Oli — 7/26/2024 10:30 AM
From what I can see it's just fud from one person, in the way he phrases things, making it look one way while that's not true
To be fair, in my experience, contractors change constantly. Not many ppl stay longer than 1-2 yrs in the same project, and imo they shouldn't. You're almost always better off job hopping, getting experience somewhere and then better position and pay somewhere else, in comparison to staying in the same company for 10 yrs
I just signed a contract for a new client yesterday, and they also don't have a teams page up for that reason. People work on a project, once it's done they move on. I don't see it differently at AXO or any startup for that matter
Sammy — 7/26/2024 10:40 AM
From what I can see it's just fud from one person

I can assure you, its not just one person. The FUD, perhaps...
Oli — 7/26/2024 10:44 AM
From what I can see from this convo, is that you would like to know how many ppl are currently working for AXO, right?
Sammy — 7/26/2024 10:46 AM
Oh, am I the fudder you're referring to?
Oli — 7/26/2024 10:47 AM
Hahaha no
You know who I mean
Just want to see exactly what info you want, and I'll see to get it
Sammy — 7/26/2024 10:50 AM
Yes, I do want to know how many are still working on Axo at the moment 
Oli — 7/26/2024 10:51 AM
Got it, I'll see to get that info, though I just want to express again these numbers change rapidly, some things might be outsourced as well, the actual number doesn't say that much in general
I also received several DMs from people interested in joining and helping out with some stuff, again on short-term contractor/commission basis
sbjuice — 7/26/2024 11:12 AM
To me it seems like axo and you are just beating around the bush in answering the actual number because of the optics. Fine they were contractors we get it but it is getting clearer and clear that answering this question is difficult for you for reasons beyond just not knowing the numbers. If they were contractors then own it and say there are no devs at this time. We are hiring.  Beating around the bush on this topic is why people keep fuding. Yes if you give us the answer and it's not great we will have to deal with it.   Like you said start up.
Oli — 7/26/2024 11:34 AM
But there's like 5 devs or something 😅 plus the rest of the team, I just haven't bothered counting everyone in the team because I have no idea why this conversation is such a big thing, I personally didn't give it any thought and thought the discussion closed
I really don't understand why you guys are so fixated on that
To me it all started with the fud and now we're here
When I use a product, I care about the product on how it benefits me and how I can use it. I very rarely care about the team, hence one more reason why I thought we moved on from this convo when we had it last time and I shed llight on it
Sammy — 7/26/2024 11:41 AM
it is as baba put it here: ⁠🐒-mal-og-crib⁠

Axo is not finished. It is not a finished product. This is exactly why it absolutely is a concern whether enough people are working on it or not 
Oli — 7/26/2024 11:42 AM
No one arguing that, hence why the short term priorities are finishing what we have, removing pain points, improving UI/UX, adding community suggestions we received (over 100) 
Improving performance, get ready for a stressful hard fork
TStorms — 7/26/2024 11:43 AM
Pretty important to know what the staff of a company that you invested in looks like.
This started out as a normal question, but was interpreted as Fud. Easiest way to deal with Fud is to show the truth. Updating the page seems like minimal effort, so we’re surprised it hasn’t happened yet
Oli — 7/26/2024 11:43 AM
Make everything more efficient
Sammy — 7/26/2024 11:43 AM
so are you confused about us wanting to know those things?
Oli — 7/26/2024 11:44 AM
Yes I am, but I'll try to get that info, even though it will change rapidly and I hope we can close this chapter
And then move on and stop wasting each other's time
Oli — 7/26/2024 11:45 AM
The original question was not how many people are currently working at AXO, let's be honest with this
The question was why people are leaving and how many left the company
And that's what we addressed
TStorms — 7/26/2024 11:46 AM
The Q was how up to date the genlambda page was. The fact that Finley asked it made you think it was Fud.
Either way the solution was to take 10mins to update the page and prevent hours of useless chatter and more potential Fud
Oli — 7/26/2024 11:47 AM
No that was only part of the question
Sammy — 7/26/2024 11:47 AM
how many are left and how many left are two sides of one thing: the team size
Oli — 7/26/2024 11:47 AM
But I would prefer we can stop talking about whatever we both think and see differently. I'll see to get a number for you guys

Is that okay?
It's just a waste of time and different interpretations and what I read seems not to be what you read

Is this really the protocol u imagined launching?  I invested pre sale because it was brought up before launch that cardano liquidity issues aren't a concern for axo because ob is so efficient. Concerns about axo being too advanced we're dismissed and everyone got wrecked at launch trying to do their part and mm being told pnl and easy strats soon. 7 months later no real docs and the only reason regular users are mm is because @Serotonin is such a superstar. 7 months after launch and the protocol feels like a beta compared to what we were told it would be.
Makes me sad I'm the one speaking on this mostly because so many og's have been silenced/ gone away
sbjuice — 7/26/2024 3:19 PM
I vote to pay @Serotonin. give him the info and he will crush it. You need documents and can't do it internally. let him into the inner circle. hire community and you will have buy-in. we are all using his starts over AXO's anyway. this way maybe some successful strats will make some money and you can release PnL and profitable strats can be seen.

Marked Safe From Titan — 7/26/2024 5:00 PM
The same cardano from pre launch when we were told axo would shine no matter what since it was light years ahead of anything in crypto. Now we're begging for the simplest of things and seeing the design constantly questioned. I've said my peace. Serotonin should get paid tho

We have competition developing
And we are now, how i see it in a “management mess” 

Anyways, we need to push keeping head down with empathy @glewellin 

We wont achieve anything saying things about cardano. Let liquidity and limit orders be the problem. Lets just do feature completeness pls
We all are aware, cardano is joke from defi, liquidity or capital perspective
Feature completeness gives us things to migrate elsewhere
We (both sides) achieve nothing but frustrations asking questions and giving justifications

We have to accept the launch was botched launch. There were expectations which are not fulfilled yet 
And tone down our choice of words when we talk of anything outside axo.
If we ourselves not worthy enough to use our funds in efficient way on axo. Thn what we will talk about cardanos defi and efficiency
Serotonin — 7/27/2024 3:41 PM
So, this is this stuff that I and others have been trying to get Axo to push for a long time. Other protocols are essentially begging to be able to provide liquidity and incentivize liquidity on Axo, but there aren’t market making strategies available for them and there isn’t any way to calculate or distribute rewards to their users who do provide liquidity on Axo.
Image
So it’s great that we got them on our side for the launchpad, but it’s also kind of putting the cart before the horse if they have to send everything over to AMMs to make things work.
Serotonin — 7/27/2024 3:50 PM
Thanks, I really appreciate it, but I really don’t have the time to be able to do all of this along with my 9-5 job, Indigo PWG tasks, the ASS, and family time. I might write down some notes of things I’ve learned while designing strategies, but it would be at my own pace. As far as other strategies themselves, I’ll tinker and come up with what I can, but nothing I can do will make new macros or other features come any faster that are needed to build more complex strategies.
Marked Safe From Titan — 7/27/2024 3:52 PM

U deserve payment but maybe at the very least they give u any tool u need to aid ur strategy journey
sbjuice — 7/27/2024 4:28 PM
Of course I didn't think you would take on the job but I think they should take notice that a community member created the most successful strats not them. It's clear they can't do it themselves. Not sure why.

 MM is the main selling point or atleast was for axo. Giving someone the tools and letting them in to the fine details is the only way they will get it done. Just being realistic. If it wasn't for you and a few others. No one would be MM. They failed I'm sorry and need to pivot their management style on getting people docs and understandable strats. You made what a strat a month? That's the KPI of the new person the decide to pay. Basically everything you have been doing for free. They should be the ones taking notes.
Sorry again for bringing you into this but I think it's important and they should be learning. This is why so many are pissed we don't have more. You did what you did with a little research and the little time you have. They have "7" axo employees and can't do it. I'm sorry they should be embarrassed. Get rid of Thor and find a Ser. Money well spent.

I agree with Serotonin; we need some MM for this pair and guidance from Axo to the Dedium team so they can provide their liquidity. If it weren't for some of us providing liquidity, we wouldn't have any volume, and this is just sad since we had the launchpad on Axo.
Marked Safe From Titan — 7/28/2024 8:25 AM

TStorms — 7/28/2024 9:12 AM
This is all behind the scenes, so people here don’t know that it’s happening.  It’s easier for people to extrapolate from Axo’s launch that underdelivered with regard to their expectations
I’m sorry for the position you’re currently in @glewellin . I really hope a few positive improvements will help change the sentiment and make it more fun to keep working on Axo while gaining some support from the community
TStorms — 7/28/2024 9:16 AM
I didn’t expect Axo to fall below private sale price, and expected an easier experience for users with some more documentation laid out
Fair point
dannycemilha — 7/28/2024 9:18 AM
Usually on other dexs when the launchpad finish the liquidity is added right after. I assumed that we had that figure it out. But I guess the next launchpad will be better. Or at least I hope so.
TStorms — 7/28/2024 9:19 AM
Yeah this is brutal
dannycemilha — 7/28/2024 9:22 AM
I agree that is was not bad, at least to me. The only thing I can conplain about is the lack of liquidity on Axo right afetr the sale ended.
And perhaps a plan to incentivize  the liquidity as MinSwap just did, offering Min rewards.
And we are doing that? Or they didn't wanted?

Serotonin — 7/28/2024 2:16 PM
Ideally, I'd like to see additional Xlang/Strategy Builder features that would make it much easier to post multiple orders onto the books. I don't know if it's possible to make it so that multiple orders could be posted from a single node or if it's a baked in requirement that you physically separate the orders. But something like doing a (s [tranche1, tranche2, tranche3], $ [price1, price2, price3]) would be much more convenient than having to build out 3 separate branches in an algorithm. This would make it much easier to post multiple bids/asks on the orderbook simultaneously so that people can see all of the liquidity (without having to relegate all of the liquidity into a single bid/ask order pair). Regardless of the specifics of how it's done, the bottom line is that we need actual "market maker" strategies that put a lot of liquidity visibly on the orderbook at more than one depth. The majority of MM and LP is typically actually done by relatively few individuals, so we can't rely on a ton of small MM to post lots of smaller strategies to fill the books (especially when there are other problems regarding fees for small MM).
Obviously, PnL and rewards/farms is another big part because we have to have a way for MM on Axo to be competitive with other protocols that provide rewards and allow dual farms. It's never going to be "easier" to MM on Axo than on AMMs. We can get it close and make it easy enough, but we will still need incentives in order to actually steal liquidity from competing protocols (and some will never migrate because it is either sticky or PoL by the other protocols).

Philippe Le Long — 7/28/2024 7:08 PM
What Cardano needs, and I hope this will improve drastically under Voltaire, is direct input from actual builders and core development from within the community. This already improved a lot since Plutus V1 was released and Voltaire could give those community builders a real mandate and funding. 
Governance could be Cardano's turning point – in either direction. I 'm feeling optimistic and curious enough to still hold a good bag of ADA (that I could sell without loss). 
Despite some of Cardano's shortcomings, most other chains have so little in common with the core crypto values that made me interested in crypto in the first place that I would probably leave the space as a whole and focus on other hobbies.

Hey guys, GM 👋 

Quick question for everyone: we received feedback to change the number notation across the platform. Currently, thousands are shown as "1.61166k". 

What would your preferred number notation be? 1.61k? 1611.66? 
What about 161.234k? Hundred of thousands? 
What about millions? How many decimals? 
Abd121 — 8/1/2024 3:12 AM
"1.61166k" is going into the sub 1 decimal units. I would say a sliding scale is better? like 1.6k is good, but 52462.6k is kind of pointless to include the decimal at that point? just how including a 0.000xx number into a single digit thousand is. ()

it seems like the the strategies bypassed the reference price of amm dexes

Yeah this isn't working. Trying to MM for all the pairs and getting burnt on it

the strategies shouldn't be quoting at the price beyond reference price
if ref price is at 2 ada it shouldn't be selling at 1.8 ada isn't it

If you really want stop this from happening, give the responsibility of choosing the pairs to the community. You won't get blamed for the strategies not working to your favor if that happens

The ref is not working as intended or at least they are not placing orders on the VOB. Jarek said that it should still work while the upgrade is ongoing but it's not the case. When can we expect it to be turn on again. Because my strategies depend on that and on the weekend I almost got rekt.

laddered orders
@Serotonin
you think we can have 3 ladder orders on each side on the VOB to reduce the chances of being the taker?
Serotonin — 8/14/2024 4:41 PM
Depends on the strategy. The CPMM that I’m hoping to release has 3 on each side, but for some reason the orders disappeared from the VOB after a while (no idea why, nothing should have been updated). I might have to add some checks to it, but when I tried it wouldn’t build because the strategy was too large. This means I’ll either have to find somewhere else to slim down the strategy size or make it only 2 on each side.
Hence my ⁠No Access post
With a Rolling Grid many of the aspects are less complex so I think I’ll be able to do 3-5 pairs of orders at a time. Yet to be seen though
Lifeless Ditto — 8/14/2024 4:44 PM

4 total with Jarek, but devops dev doesn't work directly on the platform

I really doubt going with ML labs is a smart choice. After all we didnt want to contract development out of house and prevent plagiarism
Why sudden turn of events?
Many teams have been burned to death by contracting to MLlabs. Where cost becomes the factor and MLlabs keeps it incomplete delivery due to cost factor
Oli — 8/18/2024 6:58 AM
Hmmm really?
The thing is, from what I understand from previous messages, is that a Haskell dev is not persé good at coding Plutus/plutarch etc. It actually takes a lot of time and effort to bring a Haskell dev, even if senior, up to date with how Cardano works

Mlabs is specialized in Cardano Haskell stuff, so the on-boarding is much shorter

Also the Axo lead Haskell dev is now a team lead at Mlabs, which makes it easier to onboard them to work on the Axo protocol 
I don't know about pricing etc, and I haven't really heard anything negative about them (also didn't hear anything positive though, just neutral)

Lifeless Ditto — 8/26/2024 3:00 PM

heh
or just have them do the CPMM strat once sero updated it
that's better than nothing right now (and in nothing it is all going to minswap lol)
Oli — 8/26/2024 3:13 PM
It's on my to do list to ask the team about this, just everyone is quite busy right now and we wouldn't be able to really have this conversation
But I would love that yes.... Haven't talked to Serotonin or the team yet about this, but it would be nice to hire Sero to create some kind of basket for MM, even though I know he has a very busy life juggling work, family and axo 

Discussion on this coming soon though 👍 I'll get over my whole AXO to do list soon (it keeps growing 😆 )

For Dedium, they found it a bit difficult and daunting, even though we provided all explanations and even video guides on how to set it up, but they also really want the rewards system to be live to incentivize MMers on Axo before putting some PoL

With Strike, they are interested in running MM strats with 10-20% of what will be used as liquidity, so hopefully it can be done much quicker after the sale has ended
Oli — 8/26/2024 3:13 PM
Yes, that would be the easiest at first
Marked Safe From Titan — 8/26/2024 3:18 PM
u prob are already but the biggest perk about pol on axo from what i understood was how little is needed to be efficient. can we sell them on at least putting a portion to work here?
Oli — 8/26/2024 3:19 PM
Strike said they want to put 10-20%, so that should be okay

Dedium will also put 5-10% once rewards are live
That usually, like you say, is all we need to stay competitive compared to AMMs 
Marked Safe From Titan — 8/26/2024 3:21 PM
crazy to me dedium is holding back only 5 to 10% over rewards
Oli — 8/26/2024 3:29 PM
Partly our fault for not being there enough to guide them early on, gotta take some blame for that... But we learn as we go, we did adjust a lot of things to the launchpad as well after the DEDI sale
Serotonin — 8/26/2024 3:43 PM
Not sure if the CPMM would be the best option. Unfortunately, it looks like I can only get 2 pairs of bud/ask orders to post at a time before it hits the strategy size limit. So they would probably need to deploy multiple copies (possibly with different trance scales) to have a decent number of bids/asks on the books.

I’ve got another type of grid strategy designed (similar to the Rolling Grid) but haven’t been able to test it out yet since testnet strategies can’t be created as of the Chang HF thing. Certainly, won’t be able to have it ready for after the launch in 48 hrs
But, at least it’s letting me create 3 pairs of bids/asks on that strategy in the composer. I haven’t tried to see how many I can fit before it yells at me.
Oli — 8/26/2024 3:58 PM
I really hope we will have time soon to go over your strats, with dedicated time just for this, to figure out what can be done about this
maybe something wrong in the strat, maybe we can add something in xlang, just something to get your strats ready
Serotonin — 8/26/2024 4:27 PM
One thing that would help is this ⁠No Access
I might be able to suggest other things as well, but it would require me knowing a bit more about how things work under the hood. Like, I don’t know what the scope of the functions that you make is. For instance, I’ll create a function that calculates and returns an ask price. If I call this function 5 times, I don’t know if it runs the calculation 5 times on chain (wasting compute) or if it runs it once and caches the value for the next times that it is called within that block. 
Oli — 8/26/2024 4:31 PM
Let me chase Jarek for this next week after the Strike token sale 👍
Serotonin — 8/26/2024 7:50 PM
But hey, maybe I should start charging these project who want to launch on Axo for services to design MM strategies 😆 . You can either build your own or pay me for the low fee of X and I'll create a strategy for you.

Suratay — 8/30/2024 9:07 AM
havent followed your strats @Serotonin in the last couple month. Could you give me an update which ones are the way to go atm if i want to provide single sided liquidity and for a pair i expect some larger movements?
and have you ran some of your strats through Pandas little programm to see the PnL?
Serotonin — 8/30/2024 9:32 AM
Hey, it’s been a while since I’ve published anything new, I’m still waiting for testnet to be fully functional after the Chang upgrade they did to be able to finish up a couple that I’m working on rn.

The Rolling Grid works best for single sided liquidity and can also be good for larger price movements if you use a small tranche size to allow for a large number of grid lines. The 50-50 CPMM works good for large price movements too and is slightly easier perhaps to setup. Both of those had a vulnerability that was identified about a month ago, so I recommended that people stop using them. Finley published a new variant of the Rolling Grid that has a quick fix for the vulnerability. A quick fix could be done for the CPMM as well, although, the new version is so close to being done (that will have more asks/bids on the VOB at once as well) that it’s probably worth it to just wait until testnet gets updated and go with the new version
The other one I’m working on that’s on testnet is sort of a variant of the Rolling Grid/GridMM that’s a bit easier to deploy (or rather to know where it will operate).
The quick fix Rolling Grid is here if you want to use it.

And unfortunately, I haven’t gotten around to using Pando’s  program to get PnL on a number of different strategies. I just did a before/after on a couple that were easy enough to see what the persons starting allocations were
They’re definitely profitable compared to an AMM but the market has been so bad lately it’s harder to find ones that beat out simply holding due to the IL/IR
Suratay — 8/30/2024 12:45 PM
Thanks - gonna deploy a little with the current strat and wait until the testnet gets updated for the bigger portion
Serotonin — 8/30/2024 1:37 PM

Serotonin — 8/31/2024 5:25 PM
Yea, didn’t have any luck with the new changes to the CPMM. I’ll do a little more testing and then publish a version with 2 pairs of ask/bids
Serotonin — 8/31/2024 5:33 PM
The other one I’ve got to do a little more math on so it probably won’t make it through testing rounds by this weekend
Serotonin — 8/31/2024 8:27 PM
What are you trying to do? If you'd like I can try and prioritize the grid strategy over the CPMM if you're looking to do single sided liquidity or more concentrated liquidity that isn't at 50-50

I think I've got the strategy down, but testnet is still bugging out and won't complete trades. They're even showing up under "Market trades" but nothing appears in the strategy trade history and then when I have to eject them the strategies are returned with their original assets, so no transactions appear to be going through.

Kinda funny it seemed like the alliance protocols were struggling the most with Chang
Serotonin — 9/2/2024 9:24 PM
I'm going to wait to hear back on something first. I'm getting weird behavior where it posts orders to the VOB, but then for some reason won't let them be filled by a limit order at times. I'm not sure if it's some weird compute limit thing (the strategy re-posts the same orders if you cancel the limit order) or just something odd with testnet or what
And ofc, I wouldn't mind and would give it a go if it didn't cost almost 70 ADA just to build the thing on mainnet 😂
So I don't want to waste ADA deploying a completely broken strat
Suratay — 9/3/2024 12:12 AM
Oh 😂 didn’t know it’s that expensive.
Let’s better keep testing it on testnet 😅
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 8:57 AM
Yea it seems to start at 50 Ada and increase with size. I have a habit of basically maxing out the size to try and fit as many asks/bids in the same strategy as possible
Although, most, if not all, of the issues I’m seeing don’t happen if there is a single bid/ask pair in the strategy
So, if you want to sponsor one of those I can publish it so that you can get started using it.
Or I could send you an “export” and you could publish it yourself
Marked Safe From Titan — 9/3/2024 9:11 AM
U should start a tip wallet sero. I'll gladly throw some to help ur tests
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 9:24 AM
Yea, that’s not so much the issue as it is that the strategies seem “almost ready” all the time but something just won’t work quite perfectly. Typical development overconfidence I guess.
Like, I could have (and in hindsight probably should have) published fixed versions of the Rolling Grid and CPMM a couple of days after the vulnerability was found. I was expecting things to “just work” when copying new asks/bids as it has in other strategies, but the addition of the partition seems to have introduced some other side effects. I wasn’t expecting to run out of compute so soon (still not sure if that’s the issue), then I wasn’t expecting the to_64b_ratio function to behave oddly, then I wasn’t expecting for the strategy size limit to be hit so soon, then I wasn’t expecting Chang to mess up publishing on testnet, then… 😂

Serotonin — 9/3/2024 11:52 AM
What all do you want me to publish?  Options are:
Patched CPMM w/ 1 ask/bid
Patched CPMM w/ 2 ask/bid (may stall?)
Linear Grid w/ 1 ask/bid
Linear Grid w/ 4 asks/bids (may stall?)
I haven’t gotten around to re-designing the Rolling Grid yet. Linear Grid is somewhat similar, though there are some differences. TLDR is in Rolling Grid you specify tranche size while in Linear Grid you specify the end price points. 
But the quick-fix patch for Rolling Grid is already published 
In Linear Grid you specify a min_price, max_price, and number of grid lines to deploy liquidity. Grid lines are linearly spaced (vs a fixed % above/below in Rolling Grid). The tranche size is dependent on the total liquidity so you don’t specify that.
It’s easier to know what the bounds you will provide liquidity at, but it does make it quite confusing as to what price you’ll deploy your liquidity at for a given ratio of assets. The only ones that are “easy” are single sided liquidity (one grid line above min_price/below max_price) and 50:50 liquidity (one grid line above/below the mid point price)
Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 12:36 PM
for the 4th option, is the linear grid the one with 4 orders (2 pairs of ask/bid) or 8 orders?
I am thinking of the 4th one since you can do stableswaps easier
since more liquidity is posted, it will help for more orders to be routed through AXO
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 12:58 PM
4 pairs* Up to 8 orders, 4 asks and 4 bids 
Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 1:13 PM
0.o
and it stalls?
this would be good for stableswaps
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 1:23 PM
On testnet sometimes the limit orders don’t go through. Haven’t pinned down why. I thought it was when filling 3-4 orders at once, but it has stalled with just a single order being filled depending on the size of the limit order and the size of the ask on the VOB
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 1:48 PM
I can double check, but I don’t think it stalls with just a single bid/ask pair. Unless the limit order is way above the current price, in which case I think it fills as many orders as it can before it runs out of compute.
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 2:00 PM
Well, fuck. It sounds like we won’t be getting the strategies with more than 1 bid/ask pair functioning anytime soon.
I thought once an order was posted to the VOB it could be filled immediately. Seems like the way things were designed, XLang validates each of the swaps within a strategy separately and the condition for the first swap needs to still be valid for the subsequent swaps to occur.
So basically, my strategies are trying to update the condition for what should happen after the first ask/bid occurs before the 2nd/3rd/4th bids/asks are filled and it’s throwing everything into an endless loop
Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 2:06 PM
ah
well
no use posting it then
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 2:07 PM
Sucks because this really limits what all can be displayed on the VOB. Nearly all of my strategies are forced to be iceberg strategies

Serotonin — 9/3/2024 8:05 PM
Yeah, I'm finally able to see some of the other oddities of the strategy design come into play
So like, I'm basically actually spoofing the other asks/bids
it actually ends up canceling the other orders and re-calculating the price of the lowest ask/highest bid and will then fill that multiple times within the block
And there is a discrepancy between what my initial estimate amount is vs what the updated amount is. (which is why I can tell which "version" of the order is being filled) 
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 8:17 PM
"within the block." Like, it still ends up being maker, but for whatever reason on testnet transaction that I assume should be within a block seem to take well over a block time
Image
Looks like it goes back to looping after the initial 3 that are on the orderbook are filled
Image
Alright, whatever, let me see if I can get it to work with 4 pairs instead of 3. Either way, I'll post one soon.
Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 8:24 PM
nice
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 8:24 PM
So yea, not ideal given that with enough grid lines and/or a large enough limit order your strategy and the limit order can get locked in a loop and not fill until one of you cancels the order

Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 8:29 PM
I would say it might only need it during volatile periods
and this doesn't consume credits right?
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 8:30 PM
Nope, shouldn't consume credits
Generally speaking. There might be a chance it could be taker. And for some reason on testnet it was charged 0.35 ADA the first transaction..not sure what that's about
Image
but there isn't a 0.5 ADA update cost like with the Rolling Grid
Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 8:35 PM
With the dumb grid it acts like an iceberg
While the linear shows more of it's orders
So more orders should be routed through AXO
I'd say 1000 USD should be enough to route these orders if it's even
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 8:48 PM
No, dumb grid shows everything
you just can only have up to 5 pairs of bids/asks
6 pairs with GridMM
Both of them act quirky though if you try to add assets to a strategy. You have to just completely re-deploy
Honestly, I should just make a smarter dumb grid. People probably won't have a problem deploying 3 or 4 copies if it's way easier to set them up.
And that way everything shows up on the books
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 9:04 PM

Multiple would be better
I wonder if there is a condition for the strategies where you can set (do not post if taker)

Twitter•9/5/2024 12:43 PM
U seen this?
Serotonin — 9/5/2024 2:13 PM
I saw him comment in ASB
Pi is also saying that it’s not really a node problem
I only half agree with this; They are correct in that there is no convenient endpoint that surfaces this information directly; that's not an issue, it's just that the node wasn't designed to be a platform that dApps build on, it was designed to serve the role of producing and propagating blocks. That's why TxPipe is building Dolos. So, it's a feature that would make our lives easier, but it's not an issue/bug.

Additionally, the node does expose sufficient information for this; you have access to the current ledger state, and the mempool, and it's a little inconvenient to derive your own "mempool aware state", but it's not impossible.
the node has a miniprotocol to return the chaintip state; and they have a way to return the transactions in the mempool; but, for example, there's no way to query "tell me the list of UTXOs / registered stake address / etc as of tip + all the mempool transactions applied"; you have to derive that state yourself
Then Ilya from Splash said that they are 100% using mini protocols “The problem is not in the absence of some functionality…ut in a rate at which localtxsubmission miniprotocol can process txs”
Pi: “my understanding is that localtxsubmission blocks until there is space in the mempool; so if you're facing this, it's because the mempool is full.”
“not trying to throw you under the bus btw, I totally understand the pain of building directly with the miniprotocols etc; and I'm really excited for what dolos provides.

Just not sure I agree with classifying it as "an issue with the node"”
Ilya asked what Dolos was
Then Pi answered

TxPipe are building a piece of software that acts like a node to the network, implementing a lot of the n2n miniprotocols, but notably:
1) doesn't perform consensus; so you point it at trusted peers;
2) doesn't produce blocks;
3) does index the ledger state in a way that is more optimized for common dApp queries, and provides more modern / portable APIs like gRPC, etc.

By doing this, it runs in 1% of the resource requirements of a full node, and can better serve the needs of dApps

What are your thoughts on Peras and Leios?
Ive been trying to understand them better and their timelines. Sounds like peras might be ready by early 2025 but Leios probably late 2025 at the earliest (guesses based on posts from IOG folk)
As a nondeveloper its pretty hard for me to understand all the technical docs but im doing my best. Hoping peras and hydra v1.0 are enough to keep people happy on the road to leios
exkoltibur — 9/17/2024 12:09 AM
As long as there are no block chain products that people want to use we dont need either of them
The Problem rn is that nobody is interested in doing anything with block chain and specifically cardano
And that is a bigger problem than a technological problem^^
Cardano 1.0 is basicslly complete now, but we need users
Oli — 9/17/2024 2:53 AM
That's the issue with almost all L1s right now.... And the ones that seems to have activity, mostly fake it

Aside from BTC and ETH, I don't think any L1 is really successful and has much real activity 

People were interested in blockchain stuff last cycles, but this cycle it's clear no one cares and just wants to make easy money. 

I would even argue in general, crypto is a failed project (so far, can still change in the future). Not because crypto doesn't work, but because of human nature. We don't want to be free as long as we have a bigger house than others. 

There is almost zero usage in the real world for crypto/public chains.
exkoltibur — 9/17/2024 3:37 AM
Yep right now crypto is failef
No real World usage that is worth mentioning

Its really sad to see bc all the great progress of cardano doesn't matter if nobody is interested in using it
baba — 9/17/2024 9:29 AM
Sad days are many. It takes a moment for narrative to change. Adoption to happen. The best thing to do it be prepared for the opportunity.

By that i mean, all the dapps shud be feature complete without thinking about the outcomes
If they are not feature complete. The users who comes during catalyst events, can never use it
Nobody likes to use in bear anyways
So there is no point thinking about the outcome. It comes from nowhere. The best someone can do is to be prepared
AXO shud be prepared. There is nothing else

Suratay — 9/28/2024 7:00 AM
I just looked through a bunch of $axo.treasury strats that are running for months now and dozens of them dont have traded at all besides a couple trades in like 3 month. Wouldnt it be better to re-allocate those funds into more active/newer strats? More active token pairs? Wouldnt it be more effective to focus on like a few of the top trading ada/cnt pairs and provide more capital in those pairs with tighter spreads so we do get back to some volume? i mean we are live for 9 month now and we had exactly 3 weeks of tight spreads with decent trading activity and after taking those strats down it was said they will be back up in a few days. That has never happened tho @Oli @glewellin 
Lifeless Ditto — 9/28/2024 4:51 PM
I say focusing on stable swaps strategies is a priority
There is less chance of there being an adverse movement that causes whipsaw actions that drains the treasury
I'd say just copy @Serotonin on stable swaps on USDM/DJED, USDM/IUSD, and IUSD/DJED
like the linear grid
20-30% of the treasury should be allocated in those stableswaps, since it is lower risk. More bots would probably come just to arb
Another one could be oADA/ADA, which hilariously would result in the DH/Splash Cabal scramming to find a way to make AXO swaps even worse
Serotonin — 9/28/2024 9:22 PM
I doubt you can make a strategy that can compete with Splash's tight AMM curve. Even if you set 0 spread the taker fees + Splash subsidizing their fees + how DH calculates things + RFT complaints (so no DH trades under 100 ADA) would mean that it probably wouldn't get any action. They created a Minswap ADA/OADA pool with 1M ADA TVL and it's getting no volume.

This was also posted in the Atala Discord, and forwarded in the ASB Telegram: 

Hello everyone, 

I wanted to share some important updates regarding the Atala team and the future of the Hyperledger Identus Project. 

IOG has recently undergone a restructuring that has significantly impacted the Atala team. Unfortunately, the majority of Atala, including all members of the Product team— Fay and myself included—have been let go. However, IOG has expressed commitment to continue the Hyperledger Identus Project. A small group of team members will be transitioning to Input Output Engineering (IOE) to maintain and advance the project. 

Regarding Atala products and Atala commercial pursuits, it's safe to assume they will not be developed. As of today, there are no details about the future of the PRISM Sandbox; I assume, at some point, updates will be shared. 

I also emphasize that any former IOG employee is free to decide whether they wish to remain engaged with Identus. If you choose not to continue your involvement, please let me know so I can update the Identus Maintainers List accordingly. 

I understand that this is a significant change and challenging times are coming, but this presents an opportunity for Identus to work more closely with the community, with more autonomy and freedom from IOG's internal processes.

Thank you for your dedication and commitment to the project.

Every project on Cardano works with a market maker if they’re listed on a CEX.

Why? Because they can't meet the volume requirements.

Now, it’s time for DEXs to have market makers too. That’s why we’re here. Our services are not for the public, but for projects.

⁠No Access he wants to stir the pot again...
Faketoshi — 10/8/2024 6:56 AM
Regarding your question for ideas ⁠No Access
With thin trading volume and shallow pools on Cardano, divided between 13 different DEX, an aggregator is essential or even unavoidable for the end user.
We know that DH has no good integration of AXO and a not so hidden bias in general towards other DEX's and a competition would be a healthy thing for the market overall.

I have talked with @Elder Millenial and he has expressed that he would like to work with AXO and be open to integrating steelswap into AXO.
Steelswap has good tech under the hood but lacks in UI. They would benefit greatly form the charts, statistics and general UI provided by AXO + more exposure to the end user.
AXO would benefit also because of the better integration that steelswap has for AXO orders and also benefit from traffic generated to the site (launchpad, general brand awareness) and perceived and tangible progress of AXO development in general, because it is a very user facing and visible change/improvement and not development under the hood.

Steelswap could replace the 'simple mode' and be integrated seamlessly in the UI.
The user and both parties would profit from this collaboration.
PS: Steelswap has CNT<->CNT trading, which is essential for stablecoins for example (iUSD-USDM) and stablecoins would be unbeatable on AXO - AMM pools are very inefficient in this field.
Currently is makes no sense to provide such liquidity on AXO because the traffic comes mainly via DH, which does not support CNT-CNT

dannycemilha — 10/8/2024 8:55 AM
After this happens we need the wallets, especially Vesper to integrate too, like they do for DH
Lifeless Ditto — 10/8/2024 9:10 AM
@glewellin I feel like we have a few strategies that would be useful for stableswaps. Particularly, @Serotonin 's recent strategies. Is it possible to have AXO focus on those instead of trying to do ADA/CNT? especially when AXO risks those projects pulling liquidity and causing issues (like BTN)
And will it be possible to have an API for integrating off chain bots? Genius Yield has a MM bot https://www.geniusyield.co/marketmakerbot?lng=en that users can use python to do. I would say this would allow for a stopgap measure while Xlang gets more polished
And people can have more complex trading strategies that is hidden, while also helping to pad the limit orders you guys will need to get on chain strategies working 
exkoltibur — 10/8/2024 11:02 AM
Wow nice stuff
Pushing steelswap would make a lot of sense since it is literally the only other real aggregator isnt it?

Suratay — 10/9/2024 8:15 AM
I don’t really see people trading bridged USDC tho, and bridged assets are always little less popular I guess. 

Maybe try to get some volume/attention first with USDM/iUSD/DJED before starting with bridged USDC 
And I also would not stop ADA/CNTs aswell but update the Strats to newer ones and maybe some with a tighter spread again (?) and focus more liquidity in the most popular pairs. Atm we have most Strats doing nothing for weeks and month or just having a couple trades. So they don’t really provide liquidity where it’s useful
Lifeless Ditto — 10/9/2024 8:33 AM
I would say for treasury allocation, less than 10% should be in bridged assets. 40% in stables, 20% reserve, and 30% in launchpad tokens & AXO
But I think that using existing DAO tools like clarity DAO, and asking the community to vote would encourage participation
https://www.clarity.vote/

proposals such as voting on which token pair gets liquidity will result in more participation, this will be like Sundae's reward system

volume is down overall, which is depressing. 
but what I know is that iUSD, USDM and DJED all have an expected value of $1, so having a stableswap is the less risky\

People want the usdc for liqwid but they hate the price impact so it could gain traction when people see how easy it is thru axo
Suratay — 10/9/2024 10:19 AM
I overall agree but would more say like:

40% Stables (including bridged assets)
40% 10 most traded CNTs over the last 30 Days
15% Reserve
5% AXO

But lets be honest - those are also just some numbers i came up with by thinking 3 minutes about it. Nothing i really thought about.

So someone has to bridge it first I guess.
Marked Safe From Titan — 10/9/2024 10:47 AM
That was the issue. They only bridged for liqwid and barely any for pools. Axo fixes this
Serotonin — 10/9/2024 10:47 AM
I put up a limit buy on AXO for USDC a while back and it got no bites.
So in order to MM you kinda need to first have some
Lifeless Ditto — 10/9/2024 12:55 PM
the question is whether the token holders have a long or short term outlook for the project
as staking would basically just be inflation for the sake of inflation
and it would actually pull away from MMs who provide liquidity to AXO/ADA
Gynopedie — 10/9/2024 12:58 PM
Maybe it can be mixed.  Like holding Axo or depositing it give you boosted rewards when MM.  Similar to Wing riders maybe?

dannycemilha — 10/11/2024 2:15 PM
One thing I remembered about the new innovations, ideas, etc. Is that we could have a page for swapping native BTC, ETH, and others for ADA by integrating MayaProtocol apy.
I saw that they integrated Radix a few days ago, and it works well. Made some swaps via ThorSwap and it was fast.
They are close to integrating Cardano, as they were funded by Catalyst, I think it’s a 2 to 3 months away.
This MayaProtocol is a fork of ThorChain where you can swap native BTC, ETH, USDC(Eth), USDC(arb) or others, and soon Cardano will be there. I think it could bring some liquidity and having a direct page on Axo to do it could bring some new liquidity.
For tax reasons I would use it before using CEXs and I think more people are in the same situation as me.

dannycemilha — 10/11/2024 2:30 PM
And about the risk, if you integrate, you don't keep the assets, that's the job of ThorChain and MayaProtocol
so it's a win win
unless you deposit some of your asset in the pool you could have that risk
that's why they pay you a fee to have that risk

when you swap BTC to Eth for example, itr's a 5 minute thing
and it's decentralize, that's the idea of this protocol

Oli — 10/17/2024 5:44 AM
Yes, we need to make pretty big changes there. Right now, tokens are being sent out directly. We need to adjust the system to not do this until the minimum required amount is reached. This is mostly being done by our FE dev. It involves some xlang and changes in the way orders are created (extra settings to be added)

UX wise, nothing changes for the user, except they won't get the tokens directly, and they'll see all the information in the status bar

also @glewellin , any progress on DAO formation? Clarity DAO or any other DAO tools? I think having the DAO direct the treasury for MM would engage the discord again on things, and also invite other projects to engage with AXO as well

Funny story, he was banned the moment he joined the discord, but then DMd me to be unbanned. 

I knew from day 1 it was him, but he was friendly in DM so I gave him a chance and unbanned him
Oli — 10/28/2024 2:20 AM
This comes from people who have never actually used Axo, never did a trade, never ran a strat, never did anything except backseat driving and looking at price

Not particularly interested in them, they don't participate, don't provide any feedback for us to work on, they just look at price
Oli — 10/28/2024 2:20 AM
I'm thinking of canceling these calls tbh 👍
Suratay — 10/28/2024 2:23 AM
Ok, why is that?
Dont you feel like that is the bare minimum of communication we have left atm?
Oli — 10/28/2024 3:20 AM
I think it's better to have it text-based, than a live call. The calls do serve the opportunity to connect with the community, but they aren't really fulfilling that need. Most users are looking more for concrete platform updates and feature roll-outs, rather than a general discussion. 

The last few calls were mostly just repeating information that was already shared through a discord announcement and tweet. So I would rather continue this way, to share updates as they come, when there is something substantial to share. Then the information is fresh and we avoid repetition. 

I'm thinking more to continue the updates as they come, and then compact it in a blog post to detail all the updates and accomplishments. This will include what users have been asking about the most, like PnL and rewards, on-going work with mlabs etc. 

Any questions you have can be asked on Discord and we will answer them quicker than waiting on a community call. Discord is great for direct interaction with the team, I don't think we need a live call for that. 

This approach is more efficient, it has on-demand updates and answers, which is good for transparency for everyone, including people who are not joining the calls. 

We can always have a live call when there is something substantial to share, but a fixed call doesn't bring anything good to the table. Users are interested in new features and updates and the calls don't give any alpha as everything is shared as it goes. Most of the calls are just reading what has already been announced.

dannycemilha — 10/29/2024 5:51 PM
Since you ask, I’ve put a list with of the things I would like to have for now:
I would like to have the additional signals to the “refmm” that Jarek promised on August, I’m not sure it’s working, because all the strategies that I’ve opened with USDM/ADA and other pairs didn’t post nothing on the VOB for days.
I would like to have an aggregator directly on the Axo page that wouldn’t be bias as DexHunter for example.
I would like to have some strategies made by the team that could be used by everyone and wouldn’t rekt people, meaning that can’t be gamed like many were before.
I would like to have more Macros, that were promised by Jarek, ema, ma, etc, so we can use on the strategies.
I would like to have some strategies that were on the testnet in the beginning like the Trailing, Protected Bounded, etc.
I would like to have some videos of examples on how to build the strategies or some docs, so more can come and put some liquidity.
I forgot the PnL and rewards
Lifeless Ditto — 10/29/2024 8:03 PM
I would like to have an easier way of posting multiple orders on the OB

Remember that this Maya will integrate Cardano next 
And this is native BTC, ETH, etc.
WIth the new zkBTC from BitcoinOS that is coming it could bring a lot of arbitrage opportunity
Serotonin — 10/30/2024 8:56 AM
Do you know how long it takes to go to/from BTC to Cardano?
dannycemilha — 10/30/2024 9:09 AM
True, i forgot about that. 😅 But even though it would be good to open all this doors for Axo, do you agree?
Serotonin — 10/30/2024 9:21 AM
No, that was a genuine question. Idk much about BTCOS. But the point is that arbitrage opportunities depend on how easily/inexpensively/quickly you can go from one to the other. USDM, for example, is backed by USD but can’t hold peg because it takes 1+ days and >1% fees to go one way.
I’m trying to figure out if there’s something legitimately there or if it’s basically just another bridge that, while non-custodial, would essentially have the same results on Cardano as bridged USDC/etc. from Arbitrum
dannycemilha — 10/30/2024 9:24 AM
I think you could swap from ADA to BTC in 1 hour, not great
And for USDM I agree, I guess we must wait for USDA
My point also was about bringing liquidity from outside cardano and if we have a Axo on full potential it could bring some volume
At least more than we have right now
Serotonin — 10/30/2024 9:40 AM
Yeah, all I can do is wait and see. It seems like an endless carrot on a stick. Something is always new just around the corner that's going to bring Cardano back into the spotlight, but it's never what it was originally touted to be. I had high hopes for USDM, but there was far lower institutional interest out the gate than I expected (Idk what kind of problems they had at launch), months later it still isn't available to the public, there are bank fees, slow turnarounds, and not enough liquidity to do "slow" arbitrage.
And we could have "native BTC" on Cardano tomorrow, but idk what the demand would be like, both from BTC holders trying to use Defi or ADA holders wanting to use their BTC in defi
it seems to me that most BTC maxi's dislike Cardano (really almost everyone outside of Cardano) and ADA holders don't even use their ADA for Defi so why would they use their BTC for it?
relent7ess — 10/30/2024 9:49 AM
nomadusdc held pretty well until hack at least :x

About USDM, we could arbitrage via NBX when they open the gates, no?
dannycemilha — 10/30/2024 7:17 PM

its a pretty decent bridge that polkadot ecosystem uses alot
dannycemilha — 10/31/2024 3:28 AM
But it's mainly for axlUSD from what I've seen. I assume we should have a big pool of axlUSD on Cardano side.

Swordlash — 11/13/2024 10:01 AM
It's not a direct competitor unless they are able to execute logic directly on the core exchange, like Axo (without going through submitting things on chain every time). Otherwise anybody can just have an arbitrary external logic that pulls data and places/cancels orders

Serotonin — 11/19/2024 7:25 AM
It doesn’t rely on an external price oracle at all, so that shouldn’t be an issue. The more likely thing is that, it’s single sided liquidity that was deployed at 0.37. So it’s just going to sit there and do nothing if price goes down. Liquidity is deployed between 0.37 Ada and ~2.5 Ada ENCS price.
Serotonin — 11/19/2024 7:27 AM
It’s a rolling grid so only the ENCS that are on the current grid line are visible at a time

It wouldn’t be the same issue as Danny. The Rolling Grid doesn’t use smooth spot. I haven’t been able to confirm yet if there’s been an issue or not because I haven’t physically seen orders not in the VOB for the Rolling Grid yet
I’ve only been able to see a missing order on one side of the Linear Grid. I’d need to check though and it might be an issue in the calculations of the strat itself in that case.
In other words, it feasibly could make sense why it would do that for the Linear Grid. I can’t see how it would do so with the Rolling Grid though, if that ends up being the case
Oli — 11/27/2024 8:06 AM
Okay, mlabs/Mateusz would be able to take a look if we can replicate or have an open strat with the issue

Serotonin — 11/27/2024 10:30 AM
@Oli is iSOL added to the assets list on Axo yet? I was told there are currently no AMM pools for it yet (or maybe he meant no aggregators routing to it), so it could be a nice opportunity since aggregators treat all Axo “pools” the same
And obviously, don’t enable to oracle for Minswap price yet since it will likely be unreliable
Yup no liquidity on AMMs yet with 270kAda worth minted

Philippe Le Long — 12/4/2024 3:53 PM
Well. there are at least 2 more aggregators. I choose whichever gives the best rates. So if at least one includes axo, it should provide better exchange rates in many cases.
btw,  Vespr wallet also uses Dexhunter for swapping, that's probably even "worse" than TT integrating them.

Adamarkets routes to fetch so I think they all came together.
Dev (RWP) — 12/6/2024 9:18 AM
I use an aggregator 90% of the time but if I'm trading something like memecoins I use minswap directly because there's like a 2-3 sometimes 5 minute+ delay between orders posting and when taptools reflects it =/
How do you guys feel about Bodega?
At .07, presale was .1 (but apparently they airdropped unsold allocation so it brings presale price down to like .055 or something)

0.058 public sale now. It's high risk but they say the audit for v2 contracts are about to start. Could be sold passive income to stake there. This still carbonzo tho so will see what fees v2 generates
Dev (RWP) — 12/6/2024 12:43 PM
Yeah I just want to trade it, but seems very risky as only the 1st of their 3 liquidity increases have happened and I dont think the airdrop has occurred yet
So presalers will be up ~30% when the airdrop comes. But they also wont be able to dump in high quantity with this level of slippage.
1.9m fdv seems pretty promising though for the narrative of Cardano's first prediction market

Anytime something is found after audit the auditors should have to pay the money back
dannycemilha — 12/11/2024 8:51 AM
in double
Serotonin — 12/11/2024 8:57 AM
That’s one way to make audits hella more expensive. I mean, I get it, but also that opens up a ton of legal issues, auditors have to get insurance to be able to financially accept the burden if something goes wrong, audits aren’t exhaustive and have a scope so just because there is a bug doesn’t mean it’s not something the auditor didn’t catch it could just be in some part of the code they weren’t paid to audit.
Marked Safe From Titan — 12/11/2024 8:59 AM
I'm talking only what they've audited. U mean they are responsible if something goes wrong with something they audited?
Serotonin — 12/11/2024 9:02 AM
Yea, I’m just saying that there would be constant legal battles over what the scope of the audit was and whose fault it was. And its not like auditors have millions on hand to be able to foot the bill
Marked Safe From Titan — 12/11/2024 9:03 AM
So more reason they're over valued i guess 😅
Serotonin — 12/11/2024 9:03 AM
Also, it opens up a giant hole for scams and insurance fraud. Why would an auditor be liable for tens of millions of dollars to cover someone’s shitty protocol with shitcoins that they claim were worth some amount, but were simply hot air valuations?
So I’ll go out and make some code and intentionally create an obscure hard to find bug that I can then exploit after paperwork was signed by the auditor and I know they’ll foot the cost
Oli — 12/11/2024 9:06 AM
I like how you think 🤔
Marked Safe From Titan — 12/11/2024 9:08 AM
I'm talking only pay back what they charged not cover all losses
But I get what ur saying.
exkoltibur — 12/11/2024 9:20 AM
Audit is just a waste of money. The incentives are not aligned
Auditor may just sit around and do nothing and later sign off
Nobody knows
Serotonin — 12/11/2024 10:40 AM
Ahh yea. Even then there’s still an argument that they did work and even if they caught 99% of bugs should they lose everything because they didn’t catch 100% of them. And there’s still the argument that that money goes to pay their salaries so it’s not like it sits in the bank and they have it in hand to give back, bringing insurance back in as the only alternative
Dev (RWP) — 12/11/2024 10:45 AM
If I remember anastasia did a free audit for them

Marked Safe From Titan — 12/11/2024 11:58 AM

I mean liqwid still has back doors to everything so lenfi is right about that. This just shows things can go wrong even if u do the decentralized path
dephi — 12/11/2024 12:32 PM
audits make protocols safu!
Dev (RWP) — 12/11/2024 2:16 PM
Yeah there is a big element of trust there. They use multisig similar to Aave, but the contracts are closed source so no denying that. Except elements relating to staking/voting which are open source. They will open source in time though. Makes no sense to currently imo. Notice it's the Lenfi crowd and Anastasia members who have been the loudest about it though.
Still I'll take the fully doxxed team developing longer than anyone, trying to reasonably protect a competitive advantage over a protocol that has lost tens to hundreds of thousands of user funds and has 90% of their liquidity in a memecoin and their own token.
Dev (RWP) — 12/11/2024 2:26 PM
If snek wasnt using Lenfi to loop loans and do shifty stufd their tvl would probably be like $15m
Marked Safe From Titan — 12/11/2024 2:32 PM
I like the lenfi team. They keep the crypto ethos at heart but it also caused poor mechanics in their design.
Dev (RWP) — 12/11/2024 2:59 PM
I think the crypto ethos can mean a lot of different things to different people. Its core is decentralized control and permission-less access. But both of those exist on a spectrum. For decentralization that means # of nodes, # of core developers, are those developers all one team, multiple teams. What checks and balances do they have. What control over contracts, social media, treasury do they have. The more truly decentralized you become the less quickly you can adapt or react to changes. Maybe the contracts are open source but one team member controlling the twitter could still scam all their users. Or in Lenfi's case, make a twitter post that causes a 40% price decline in 1 hour and cascading liquidations.
If they wanted right now they could close source the code like they did, switch to a new contract, tell people to supply to the new contract and then withdraw all funds by backdooring it.
Dev (RWP) — 12/11/2024 3:07 PM
I've seen their team members talk quite a bit of shit personally and the people in their inner circle are somewhat known bad actors in my book. Bison/dubbleu/conundrum/rami/shillmo and others. Their bread and butter is pump/dump, botting LPs, creating fake hype on twitter while they dump on people, looping snek loans to run up price (no proof of that last one but I'm 90% sure). That and the fact that one of their 2 audits was a freebie that they touted as a badge of security, only for this to happen.

This is free marketing. The discussion will go outside of the cardano forum when it gets more concret. I just don't get this total abandonment. Even in an EVM world with infinite competition, would a track record of total neglect on the previous chain, not be a good starting point.

Maybe, maybe not - I am not the ceo of axo and I am not in their shoes or have anything to do with the decision but to go stealth mode for month and only blame Cardano? I mean … not the way I would have imagined things going

It is , if you feel minswap is doing good volume wise. Its also funding operation from token sale. Plus taptools sc is not OSS, so data is definately cooked. There were evidences of wash trades on minswap for minswap pairs to make volume more. 

Anyways! I side with both, but i may sound like i side more with axo. Why not, i am still invested, i will try to find rationale behind decisions where it looks bad

In a corporate world, nobody accepts mistakes until succesful. You find ways to navigate by blaming here n there. For sure cardano is partly at fault.

If they come and accept their partly mistakes before suuccess, there will be similar reaction again

Yeah and that’s fine aswell - don’t want to put fuel in the fire anyway. Just lost hope more than I had already so that’s also just a way to get that of my shoulders
baba — 3/2/2025 12:15 PM
Where people coming and yelling and asking money back , apologies bla bla

It's 100% jarek's fault with poor management and not willing to listen to any other ideas until it was too late. Then deflecting accountability since launch
Axo could have done something if he listened about pnl, rewards, docs, dex aggregation, even using/ building amm into axo, etc Pride fucked this up

Oli — 3/2/2025 4:29 PM
Yeah I'm spending some time on Twitter
Marked Safe From Titan — 3/2/2025 4:31 PM
Is it axo related or ur personal? I was gonna follow.
Oli — 3/2/2025 4:33 PM
It's personal, but got doxxed recently by finley, so I can share

Though it's almost no crypto, mostly politics, anti EU stuff for the most part, not sure thats interesting 

@smalls_kitty is the handle
Marked Safe From Titan — 3/2/2025 4:34 PM
Oh. I figured if I saw u jumped ship it's definitely over 😄
Oli — 3/2/2025 4:36 PM
I'm still not convinced it's a rug, but I'll know more tomorrow 👍
pibe age — 3/2/2025 6:47 PM
you were the best of us :love: lot of respect for you

Hey @Oli I know you are just shoveling shit for jerek and have been for a minute. I get it you got make a living but Is Jerek going to step out and speak or is he just a coward. It's clear the guy couldn't run a lemonade stand but if it isn't a rug tell the dude to speak about it. I already chalked this dump as a loss awhile ago. I know, I know, you will pass it on but yeah pass on that he's a coward. Would mean alot
Oli — 3/3/2025 1:20 AM
GM, I'll be online in about 30mins, I'll talk with him and see what is up 👍 
Marked Safe From Titan — 3/3/2025 8:19 AM
Any news?
exkoltibur — 3/3/2025 8:33 AM
Probably there is only a jarek LLM left that oli has been talking to since a year^^
Suratay — 3/3/2025 10:39 AM
Just had a look into AXOs Swiss registered company but it seems like they closed it June last Year
Maybe old news but i heavent read anything about that up to now
Maybe you can get some infos on that aswell @Oli
Oli — 3/3/2025 10:48 AM
Nope... Haven't had a meet yet with the team, they would reach out to me in the afternoon/evening, so still waiting
Oli — 3/3/2025 10:49 AM
I can ask when we talk 👍
Suratay — 3/4/2025 1:23 PM
Did you talk to Jarek/the Team today?
Oli — 3/4/2025 1:32 PM
Not yet

They reached out yesterday but was too late for me, and today I haven't been contacted. Will try again tomorrow 
Marked Safe From Titan — 3/4/2025 2:38 PM
They're ducking u now?
Oli — 3/5/2025 3:44 AM
Don't think so, can't confirm until I get to the bottom of it... I'll come in here as soon as I know what the plan is
Philippe Le Long — 3/5/2025 4:06 PM
gotta admit, even though I haven't been active here in a while, this whole situation really does make me a bit sad.
Marked Safe From Titan — 3/9/2025 2:02 PM

Marc also deleted his messages 
Suratay — 3/13/2025 2:50 AM
