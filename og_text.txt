There is a great Cardano TG called "ADA Street Bets", with many founders of Cardano projects. They hold an internal list of proposals from members of that channel. 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13gutlF6lRwWRfKf9S6XhpU4v10KS-o7FeTLo4-2NxCY/edit?gid=541890420#gid=541890420

Usually, these are of better quality

Hey guys, quick update on the limit order issue: it's an issue on DH side and we provided them all the info on how to fix it 👍 
Philippe Le Long — 7/2/2024 10:23 AM
Thanks for the update. Can you elaborate why the wrong limit price is shown in the sxo UI when viewing the strategy?
Oli — 7/2/2024 10:28 AM
It's because behind the hood a smart market order is a limit order with a baked in slippage of 2%. So technically you can enter whatever limit price you want. But because it's a smart market order and not an actual limit order, this limit price is ignored. DH had to make an actual limit order and not a smart market order for the limit price to be taken into consideration.
Philippe Le Long — 7/2/2024 10:31 AM
Is this hardcoded somewhere behind the scenes? When inspecting the underlying xlang algo, it looks to me like the smart market order is basically a regular limit order.
Why even have the option of entering a limit price if it doesn't do anything?
Oli — 7/2/2024 10:32 AM
You don't have the option to do that, DH is just using some special order submission
They just didn't configure it correctly and used smart market instead of limit order
Oli — 7/2/2024 10:33 AM
No idea, maybe it's on OME level, I'm not enough knowledgeable about these things
But either way, we shouldn't get too technical, it's not something a regular user can do anyway
Once it's fixed, it won't happen again, just wish they did some manual QA for this
Philippe Le Long — 7/2/2024 10:35 AM
In the composer it looks like a limit order.
Image
Philippe Le Long — 7/2/2024 10:35 AM
I love getting technical though 😄
I still have a few items on my list to ask Jarek  that he didn't want to spoil before the launch 😉
Oli — 7/2/2024 10:37 AM
There is a difference, not sure how though
It's a limit order 2% above spot, so you get best price up to 2% and if not filled, order closes 
Philippe Le Long — 7/2/2024 10:46 AM
Appreciate your responses!
Philippe Le Long — 7/2/2024 10:50 AM
Hmm,  it seems like axo doesn't entirely work like I thought it did. Viewing the underlying algo of a strategy should normally reveal exactly how that strategy works. I might be missing sth. though, @Serotonin is our xlang specialist
Hamilton — 7/2/2024 12:11 PM
"Basic mode = smart market (safer and works like limit order with a price that crosses slightly ask price)." - Jarek
Serotonin — 7/2/2024 12:17 PM
I would think this is the case, but I think minpwr? was able to import a strategy from a json a while back (they might have disabled this capability?). I don’t imagine, if that’s the case, that any of the wiring diagram would have automatically populated, so I suspect that there can be some mismatch between what the wiring shows and what the strategy actually does.
That said, when I looked at the smart market strategy it simply posts and order at $price and looks identical to the Limit strategy (because after all, a smart market order is a limit order placed some threshold above/below the spot). I don’t recall seeing anything about slippage in the strategy, so I don’t know where that is set. It also doesn’t answer why the strategy viewer would show a limit price different from what was posted on chain. 
dephi — 7/2/2024 1:15 PM
hey @Oli, might have missed it but can we have a tweet about the buyback? i mean discord announcement is nice but siloed
Abd121 — 7/2/2024 3:58 PM
Turkey annouced Crypto regulations
and they're incrediably liberal
normal things such as mandatory anti fraud and money audits for exchanges, mandatory "keep exchange and customer funds seprate" stuff. but self custudy is protected, "crowdfunding" is legalized 
Banks are allowed to hold crypto for you too if they get a crypto liscense which most probably will

Abd121 — 7/2/2024 4:02 PM
only bad thing is that international exchanges are disallowed, so Binance global is probably gonna close my account

since most my usage isn't really with exchanges anyway
Abd121 — 7/2/2024 4:12 PM
wait
I am actually no longer sure
if they define wallets as a platform
is so then it's the opposite and it'd be very bad
ok they do seprate platforms and wallets wooh
that could've been very bad
still no taxes for now
Philippe Le Long — 7/2/2024 4:40 PM

I had 100 credits

it should be at 98 minimum no?
🔥HOTSKY🔥 — 7/3/2024 6:30 PM
Serotonin — 7/3/2024 10:09 PM
It’s a known thing that they are trying to add to the credits history. When I made the strategy I thought that it would update the Eval Variables when a match was made (using the takers fees) but unfortunately it updates those variables from your own credits after the trade has happened. Because of this it will use roughly 0.5 Ada in credits when it updates the grid line
Oli — 7/4/2024 2:31 AM
What Serotonin said 👍 we have a product spec to add these eval update credits

Serotonin — 7/4/2024 5:04 PM
Alright, I've got a strategy that I made per request and I'm trying to figure out which of these it would fall under
Image
I think I'm going to call it a "Staircase Take-Profit"
Basically, you define a starting price, tranche size, and step % and it will sell a tranche at the price and then increase the price by the step % for every next tranche, until the strategy runs out of funds
so, it's essentially one half of the Rolling Grid, but never buys back in
What do you all think? I'm kinda leaning towards "Technical"
It's not really around the spot price, and it tries to always place limit orders so I don't think that's the best
And it's fairly simple, so I don't know if I'd consider it "Advanced"
Serotonin — 7/5/2024 9:12 AM

You can’t really time the market, but it just sucks trying to raise funds for a token when Ada just bled 15% in a day and BTC is turning bearish.
Faketoshi — 7/5/2024 2:14 PM
Agreed and it would not be the first time that a token sale is postponed due to market conditions.

So you changed the rules on this discord? The mods where always relaxed and more on the shit-talk tolerant side and only unhinged insulting sprees like from Detoxx where a reason to take drastic measures. You said that even a clown-emoji is to much?
Not cool.
Oli — 7/7/2024 6:42 AM
I will not allow being disrespectful 👍

I am very relaxed, shit talking is fine, negativity is fine, criticism is fine, just have to remain respectful

Look at my conversation with sbjuice and minpower for an example of a difficult but respectful conversation 👍 
Insults is an insta 3 day mute, that's for sure, that's disrespectful for everyone
There will of course be warnings first, I don't like muting people, even less banning. It's not something that should generally be done. But it's usually the only thing left after multiple warnings

I'm quite leniant when it comes to those things
Faketoshi — 7/7/2024 6:47 AM
Idk. Respect has to be earned and is no human right. But if these are the new rules, then it is what it is.
Oli — 7/7/2024 6:47 AM
If I tell you to fuck off, would you be okay with that? 😅 I think any cm anywhere would mute that person
That's not something that should be said to anyone, let alone a team member 
Everyone should be respectful to one another on this server, no one likes insults and trolling other people

If warnings don't help, then a mute is warranted
Sammy — 7/7/2024 6:50 AM
that is where context is important, which we now dont have. depending on the discussion a fuck off may be acceptable or not, even if youre a team member 
Faketoshi — 7/7/2024 6:50 AM
This was not the culture on this server, but I guess it is now.
I know where you're coming from and that this is common in most places, that you have to be extra careful what to say to not offend anyone.
Oli — 7/7/2024 6:52 AM
No never. Regardless of the context.

Read the conversation I had in price talk yesterday with sbjuice and minpower. That's how it should be done

If I ask someone to not be disrespectful and to keep it positive, and in response get a fuck off, then you get muted
Oli — 7/7/2024 6:52 AM
It has nothing to do with watching what you say or not to offend anyone.

A fuck off is never acceptable
Faketoshi — 7/7/2024 6:52 AM
Thats your opinion. This is not universal tbh.
Oli — 7/7/2024 6:52 AM
You cannot not offend anyone, that's not the world we live in

But insults is a no go
Monday everyone will be unmuted. I hope we can continue with staying respectful
Again, take an example of sbjuice, minpower, and the conversation were having right now.

This is perfectly fine
Sammy — 7/7/2024 6:54 AM
No never. Regardless of the context.

That is your opinion and youre the the mod now . Thats all there is to it
Oli — 7/7/2024 6:59 AM
Thanks for the feedback 👍 muting someone for saying fuck off is not about a personal opinion, I need to maintain a respectful environment in the server. Aggressive language like that goes against principles of staying respectful. We need to allow anyone to have civil and open discussions and a fuck off has no place in this. It's nothing personal

They will be unmuted on Monday, let's hope everyone can remain respectful to everyone
Sammy — 7/7/2024 7:01 AM
If I ask someone to not be disrespectful and to keep it positive..

Also, "asking"/forcing someone to keep it positive when things are not positive, is a very cynical thing to do. Perfectly understandable if some snap at that point 🙏
Oli — 7/7/2024 7:01 AM
No need to keep it positive, that's not needed. Just keep it civil and respectful
You can be negative all you want, you can give criticism all you want, that's all fine
Being disrespectful is not
Again, look at the conversation I had with sbjuice and minpower. Wasn't the most positive one, but was respectful 
And that's fine
It's not easy staying positive with the token price and some core features not being released yet, that's okay
I get it 
But being disrespectful is not okay
It's also not easy for me staying positive seeing pretty much 1/3 of my crypto wealth being so hard down, so I get the sentiment
Just stay civil is all I'm asking
Sammy — 7/7/2024 7:06 AM
Then dont tell people to keep it positive. Its like telling a person who's furious to "calm down".
Oli — 7/7/2024 7:06 AM
I won't 👍 that's fine
TStorms — 7/7/2024 8:42 AM
This is prob why we’re all a bit surprised @Oli .
We used to be able to tell each other to fuck off regularly because we’d limit it to who we knew was in the server and could ‘take it’, realizing that it wasn’t personal. They probably expected you to fit that profile too since you’ve been here a while and are involved
Looks like we’re going into a more filtered direction which is fine, just letting you know where our surprise came from.

I’d like to add a gfy joke here, but now I’m kind of scared I’d get banned/muted too :malsweat: 

So… go hug yourself :malheart: :malgrin:
Oli — 7/7/2024 8:48 AM
Thank you for your message, it is interesting and puts it in a different perspective which I didn't have before 👍 

OG channel I will be super super lenient, here is different as only a few amount of ppl are in. It's your little place. If you don't want me here, I can even accept that and leave the OG channel 👍
And jokes are totally fine, it depends on context as others have said here. 

On public channels I need to be a bit more strict, I would rather keep it clear from foul language before it turns into just that, people disrespecting each other making it an unpleasant place for the community 
Sammy — 7/7/2024 8:58 AM
That's what was so special about this place (and I mean the whole server), we used what you consider foul language but it never devolved into an unpleasant place. But those seem to be bygone days.

Serotonin — 7/7/2024 7:32 PM

relent7ess — 7/7/2024 7:32 PM
there is a difference between these
Serotonin — 7/7/2024 7:32 PM
Sure, we want mindshare. I don't see it happening until there is at least 500k USD in a pair to trade
probably closer to 1M per side
relent7ess — 7/7/2024 7:34 PM
i think 50k should be sufficient.
its not a curved afterall
Serotonin — 7/7/2024 7:34 PM
But even then, I mean is there really a "mindshare" to speak of on ETH and other chains? Like, afaik, yes there are a quite a few people trading them, but I assumed that the bulk of the volume originated from the different stables providing different returns/opportunities on various protocols and so there was a necessity to swap between them
relent7ess — 7/7/2024 7:35 PM
sort of because most dexes incorporated v3 uni
so the spread between dexes is minimal
it becomes a compeition to drive the organic demand.
unless u are making that big of a trade
And perhaps its more important for OB
relent7ess — 7/7/2024 7:59 PM
@Serotonin dumb grid is probably enough to start quoting for the pair i guess
Serotonin — 7/7/2024 8:01 PM
Yup, that's the "free" version.
Rolling Grid can make more grid lines (semi-infinite), but costs ~0.5 ADA to update the internal parameters in the RFT each time one grid line sells out and it has to re-draw them. It also has a specific grid layout, whereas you can do any layout you want with the Dumb Grid 
Also, GridMM is probably an easier one to setup than the Dumb Grid
I'm going to try and come back to the Rolling Grid at some point and make some fixes so that it doesn't cost credits all the time. I think it would have to be a linear grid scaling vs logarithmic (percentage) though.

lol still wishing that aggregator is cooked up and default mode is set to simple mode
would also be nice if there is a indicator showing ur limit orders on the orderbook ladder
dephi — 7/8/2024 5:08 AM
anybody know why there are tiny buys in the buyback? 0.37 ada buy, resulting in 0.75credits used doesnt seem to be useful
Image
Oli — 7/8/2024 5:28 AM
I think it has to do because on an order book the matching is done peer 2 peer, matching a buyer directly with a seller. Perhaps at that exact price point, there was only 1 seller (1 strategy) with that amount of funds

Just thinking out loud, I'm not sure
Suratay — 7/8/2024 7:29 AM
But wasn’t it said that matches below 5 ada will not match for that exact reason?
Oli — 7/8/2024 7:45 AM
Maybe total match was 5ada across two different prices, not sure if that makes sense 

Not sure about the exact technalities
So it's 1 seller, but strat moved price just slightly for 1 order above 5ada
Maybe @Serotonin has an idea before I ask the team
Serotonin — 7/8/2024 8:10 AM
No, I don’t know why sometimes orders < 5 Ada are possible to go through. I imagine it’s if there is 2 orders that are matched in the same block and the OME doesn’t have a chance to blank out the portion with < 5 Ada?
Like, I’m pretty sure aggregators are ever so slightly underestimating their sizes on Axo so they don’t end up charging the user more credits for a tiny amount. This leads to a tiny amount being left from someone’s order that might be filled if someone else jumps in quick enough

Sammy — 7/8/2024 11:20 AM
That is how you make a dog beg,  or a child say "pretty please", by holding  something out  of their reach.

I dont know where you grew up but your ideas of what  is unacceptable or what basic decency is not shared by many other people, dont overvalue your views. That part where you have  to  earn respect, I  1000% agree with. So far, youre way underwater

This has nothing to do with "the team" it is entirely concerning an incompetent leader and his power trippy discord mod
exkoltibur — 7/8/2024 11:53 AM
I don't really see why you think jarek is incompetent. He built the whole thing... communication is not really good sometimes (incl right now) but that's really not a reason to hate him with a passion
Be honest: is the reason you are so angry with jarek that you lost money with axo token?
🔥HOTSKY🔥 — 7/8/2024 11:56 AM
Finley — 7/8/2024 11:58 AM
If you think this is about "communication" then you're extremely well versed at not paying attention to anything, I've said what the problems are in here before and the moment I uttered them outside of this channel I was muted. I'm not going to repeat myself if you cant be bothered to remember what was said in the past or go and look for yourself.
baba — 7/8/2024 12:30 PM
Whatever youre doing. Its not helping somebody get positive energy out of your criticism but a rant, negativity and even insults. 

You might be right saying it first time. I feel it right. But youre not leaving it, it proves nothing. 

The only point by bringing mute option is for you to make it feel cooled down, and come back and be part of it. But as soon as unmuting is done, you start with same energy as earlier. 

I have to say this after observing your comments from many many days. 

Jarek build this thing. The man can have flaws, the product cant have success. But i do know there is absolutely nobody who can achiever even little to what he has achieved today. 

When it comes to management and development with little finances you have got, you make many mistakes to achieve results in fastest possible manner, in crypto in secured manner as well as youre playing with real funds of others. 

So please calm down. You have said what you have said. Pls dont push more to this, and move on
Finley — 7/8/2024 12:31 PM
I came here to get unmuted and got ego checked
I haven't said a word in here in a month

Serotonin — 7/8/2024 12:48 PM
Jfc can everyone stop acting like teenagers?
Finley: Stop being so insulting and aggressive. I don’t know what exactly you’re trying to achieve, but even if you’re points are completely valid it’s not going to get anyone to rally behind you or change Jarek’s opinion if you’re so coarse and boisterous. You’ll get way further with people if they can empathize with your position and that’s not going to happen the way you’re approaching it.

Oli: Please quit egging him on. I realize you put up with a lot of bullshit in all of the various channels and in your DMs but the older brother power trip “say please” stuff isn’t helping diffuse the situation and you know it. Please try to be the bigger person here.

Jarek: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE listen to your team, TRUST THEM, and don’t try to micromanage them. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good. There’s too much work to be done and most times getting something out is way better than waiting until everything is perfect (docs are a prime example). Most things can be fine tuned later. I hope we can all agree that your time would be better spent working on things like documentation or making sure that LSE strategies can’t be gamed than moderating the intricate details of aesthetics or communications.

Sorry man I just want to get unmuted :/ I played nice for 4 months slowly finding out what is happening internally and did my part in trying to gently push for meaningful change. That didn't work. The time for gentle pushing and positive reinforcement has long passed by and I spoke up about that many weeks ago now. The ship will sink if our glorious leader wont stop steering it directly into the mother of all icebergs; but I've already accepted that fate based on his actions since launch some 7 months ago now. I convinced the people who I intended to when I made my original stance known and I've no intention to carry on at it. Like I said I'm just here to get unmuted :joeshrug:
Finley — 7/8/2024 1:05 PM
Also I hate to tell you Sero but you are on a long... long... list of people who have politely and respectfully tried to get Jarek to smell the coffee and fix his shit. Of course you are absolutely right I am incredibly aggressive and insulting towards him and his lackey and for that of course I apologise to you and all of the OGs who bare witness but take no pleasure. If the change required to stop this ship sinking is ever to be had, it will be so when the flames have kindled jareks feet to a crisp. But even then his pride and arrogance would never allow such things to happen. 
baba — 7/8/2024 1:08 PM
Great to hear you being a bigger and better person here. @Oli too being a nice guy here to try to school in his way. I am sure you guys can handshake in some eventful day.

Maybe i am not aware. But whats with the information about jarek being so salty? Whats the thing that holding it back for team to deliver?
I can smell that he has tremenduous pressure to make axo succesfull, and i can give him free pass on somethings. But i would be happy to know for info sake

Similar to Cardano, but not sure of the details

If you want to read about how badly funds were used, search for "polkadot marketing" on Twitter and read the first few top posts...

Tldr, millions and millions were used on marketing efforts with close to zero return on investments

Some influencers got paid a way too high amount, they spend money on dumb stuff like paying millions for a gif as a token icon on CMC etc...

I see similar things potentially happening on cardano
exkoltibur — 7/8/2024 2:17 PM
These things absolutely must not happen on cardano
If it does, crypto is dead
We really need to fight for that otherwise its all over

I didn't use polkadot personally but from what I've heard the main problem was that funds could've better been spent on building out infrastructure and dapps and improve the user experience

Marketing did bring in users, just for them to notice how bad the ecosystem was and how little you could do there. And the things you could do just had bad UX

Yes of course, it's on the list of priorities 👍
But generally, in startups, it's normal to have people join and leave at certain points, hire new people etc. People usually don't stay for years in the same company as they're looking for new challenges and exciting projects to work on
Oli — 7/9/2024 12:23 PM
Just checked official statistics, and official median employee tenure in startups is 2 years

So nothing out of the ordinary for AXO 
I've worked for several startups since 2019, people usually don't stay longer than 2-3 years, doesn't mean the company is doing bad, no need to stress for employees coming and going in startups is what I'm trying to say 👍

Having him answer some questions and concerns needs to be put into the looonnng list of priorities? Come on. The priorities of the project are one of the concerns. I think being transparent and answering some questions is a priority that won't take to much time. Especially for the OGs. Not saying we should get special treatment nor do we want to dog pile but some answers would go a long way. Little AMA action.

I don't know who needs to hear this, but a Cardano L2 does a presale just days before Dedium and they had to double the amount of tokens per ADA given in the sale and then lower the cap to 500k and promise bonus perks and it still wasn't filled.
The degens in Cardano are milked absolutely dry and Dedium should not launch in this environment (trying to raise 4m+) as the first, shining example of the AXO launch pad.

@Oli also a question for the next office hours.
How will Axo plan on advertising/displaying rewards for liquidity providers? Like, it’s not as easy as throwing up an APR on a strategy because each strategy has an infinite number of parameters that would yield different “HRA” in Axo.

Dunno. I caught it mid way and can’t be bothered to analyze it. Might not be that much lost at all, but still. Just throw up some grid strategies or the AMM equivalent with a small amount of funds so they have to at least work through some limit orders to get to the main LSE strategies. I’d rather the LSE have some IL/IR on a small amount of funds then it going to these people milking them

Serotonin — 7/15/2024 11:18 AM
Good to know that they weren’t able to steal any funds
I actually thought about making a trap strategy that would prey on people trying to milk these strats. If it knew a-priori what the parameters from a “bait” spread MM strat were then it could wait and not post an order until that spread strat started being gamed.

pre-trade orders got filled at wrong price because of how the OME works
the pre-trade orders were makers, and they filled at the order price
once live-trading started, and new orders coming in were takers, these ones did fill at best price, so at 0.0875

about 300 wallets are impacted and will get their missing funds soon
Serotonin — 7/18/2024 9:28 AM
Taptools double counts the volume because the Dedium wallet that's providing funds counts as another p2p trader.

Serotonin — 7/18/2024 11:01 AM
What's going on? Are the market buys going just below the list price?
Image
I assume re-deploying that limit order into a new strategy just below those buys to fill them will mess up the % sold tracker? 
And it looks like there'd be about 1k ADA stuck that wouldnt' get filled at that price
Oli — 7/18/2024 11:10 AM
All fixed 👍
Market orders were created at 0.08749999999 instead of 0.0875

But rounding error fixed and new orders should go through

Pending orders have to be canceled and recreated
Serotonin — 7/18/2024 11:12 AM
The people who put those in probably aren't going to be happy if they can't get their new order in below 0.0925
Do you want to try and just fill the pending orders so they don't have to be canceled?
Like, just manually buy 75.6 kADA worth off the market and then sell it back to fill those pending orders 
Oli — 7/18/2024 11:15 AM
There's still 1M left at 0.0875

If there are issues and people don't get in because of our mistake, then AXO will make them right
We'll leave it as is for now, I'm going offline
I'm kinda on holiday and really want to get away form the stress right now 😅

Been a hectic day
Serotonin — 7/18/2024 11:17 AM
That's what I'm saying, have AXO use ADA in the treasury to right now just buy the 864k DEDI needed to fill those orders and then sell that DEDI in a limit sell at 0.0874 ADA to fill those pending orders
Oli — 7/18/2024 11:17 AM

Are new orders still going to that 0.08749999 price? BIDs just jumped from 12k to 17.6k
Image
Back to 12k, maybe it was just a visual glitch
Image
Either way, I'd still fill that last 12.6k worth of bids. The complaints of people who didn't get filled isn't worth the 700 ADA you'd lose on the trade buying at 0.0925 and selling it back to them at 0.0875
Oli — 7/18/2024 1:06 PM
Sorry only saw your message now

Considering the hacking we had to do to get the tokens at 0.0875 and sell back at 0.087499, we won't do this last part

We did fulfill slightly more than 700k DEDI this way, so that's pretty nice

Jarek and the whole team really appreciates your input here 🙏

Yeah there were unforeseen issues

Pre-trading orders being makers, and since smart market are limit orders, and they were makers, well they filled at that price
We had 30-45mins of orders staying pending due to a rounding issue m
Bevause Dedium team closed and re-opened the selling strats, the percentage counter stopped working as we were following these 2 strats

I just don't get why it's even there

Should be tomorrow yeah
Oli — 7/18/2024 4:36 PM
I'm not sure about the contract or whatever, but what I do know is that, of course we're getting all the trading fees + all the LP, generating more fees

If any other payment was involved or whatever, I don't know
sbjuice — 7/18/2024 4:39 PM
so this took priority of all the other items that bring value to axo and it was done for fees and it wasnt good!!! holy shit. you should just go sit by the beach dude hahaha.

It generated over 2mil ada in volume today, highest pair so far

We'll see the volume after the sale

yeah im sure they will fuck it with one of thier strats again
no one cares about a luanch pad and im sorry this launch aint making waves in the cardano community like it was the best thing since sliced bread. the value vs other items is garbage im sorry im saying it. stop taking the heat and go on vaca man.

Or is that ~11kADA made?
Sold a little under 5k ADA worth of MNT slightly below cost (maybe -1k ADA worst case) to shift the price down and then spent another 12k buying it at less than half value (-12k ADA) to end up with ~24k worth of MNT (+24k ADA)

Appreciate you keeping us all updated. Hope team is starting to prioritize your input, more.
Serotonin — 7/20/2024 2:18 PM
I might be making it up, but I think I saw a super low limit order at basically 0. I'm assuming that they threw some in there to make it look like the order book had depth. There's over 2 hours in between those orders so it seems like they're targeting pairs that arbitrage bots don't work on
Yeah, the limit order is still there
Image
exkoltibur — 7/21/2024 8:50 AM
How does that work? Who sold a big amount for half price?
Serotonin — 7/21/2024 10:54 AM
The LSE strategy
Basically place orders such that it tricks whatever the strategy sees as the “spot price” whether that be on Axo or in low liquidity pools on other DEX and it will put its liquidity around that price.
exkoltibur — 7/21/2024 3:03 PM
Ok I dont know how that particular strat works. But find it surprising that it buys more than it sold before
So its not symmetricaö
Serotonin — 7/21/2024 8:15 PM
The strategy is the one on the opposite end of those trades. So the person gaming the strategy is the one who sold at 0.258 and then bought back and 0.075 and 0.143. The LSE strategy was the one that lost out by buying at 0.258 and then reselling that same MNT and more at 0.075 and 0.143.
Or maybe I'm reading it wrong and the person didn't even have to sell MNT, they might have just gamed it and only bought.
Either way, the point is that the LSE strategy sold 20-25k ADA worth of MNT at half price or less
Meaning it's out 10-12k ADA
exkoltibur — 7/22/2024 12:01 AM
Oh I get it now
Should actually be quite easy to game those things then bc you can see all the lse strats

Lol, people really hate Axo for no reason. Like, if they complained about MM then I get that, but they’re all “just put LP on Minswap or SundaeSwap” because they want to buy from an AMM
🔥HOTSKY🔥 — 7/23/2024 3:03 PM
I hate liquidity not being on AXO is about the only thing I don’t like about AXO
I’d also like rewards for MMing
dannycemilha — 7/23/2024 3:31 PM
It's really hard seeing all of those comments.
Serotonin — 7/23/2024 3:41 PM
I’d like MMing to be easier. That would definitely help liquidity. I’m just worried that it’s still at a stage that’s too difficult for most people. Like, if this is the type of flak that we get when people don’t even know about MM then boy we will be in for some once they go through the learning curve.
There still aren’t good strategies publicly available for true market makers to reliably deploy tight liquidity. No way to guarantee they won’t be takers and eat it with fees. All of the grid strategies out right now are iceberg strats that don’t leave a ton on the books at once
🔥HOTSKY🔥 — 7/23/2024 3:50 PM
Yep super sucks that all the noobs like me started out with AMM as the norm
dannycemilha — 7/23/2024 3:51 PM
It would be bad if after all this, the liquidity goes to Min ou Sundae
People just wanna trade even if they are losing a lot more on the Slippage.
I think most all they want is a deep liquidity so they can dump as fast as possible

Philippe Le Long — 7/23/2024 4:35 PM
Is there no way to guarantee the strat will only be a maker? Seems like an oversight. Maybe it could be a property of the strat?
Serotonin — 7/23/2024 5:13 PM
Yea, I’ve requested that they make a flag of some sort. Idk if that would work with the way the OME is written though. I’m placing things outside of the min_ask and max_bid but those always refer to the last block, so if an order comes in the same block as your strategy updates then it’s a toss up as to which is considered “first” to be the maker
Philippe Le Long — 7/23/2024 5:15 PM
Like on Kraken, where you can set your order to post as limit order or sth. like that to ensure you're paying maker fees.
I'm sure it would be possible, albeit not completely trivial.
Oli — 7/24/2024 9:28 AM
Don't forget Minswap has many minions over social media being paid to shill minswap and dunk on others 👍 not saying they're that, but they exist
Serotonin — 7/24/2024 9:33 AM
So why has there been no one to help Dedium provide liquidity on Axo? They’re waiting for a response from whoever they went with for a MM (either GSR or Trireme) but I don’t suspect those companies know anything about MM on Axo, so it will be another few days at the bare minimum for them to put anything other than limit orders down. They should have had strategies planned, built, and tested before they even launched. Meanwhile the masses are demanding they put liquidity on AMMs and the first 50k PoL appears to have gone to SundaeSwap.
Oli — 7/24/2024 9:42 AM
We are in talks with them about it, but can't really share more about it. All I can say is there was some confusion on their part about who was going to do what, but we're setting it up together with them as we speak

I am so busy in my corporate job that i have to skip todays connect. But here are my ques if i could get answers pls @Oli 


1) What is AXO priority right now for next two months? 
2) Why there is a delay for docs n rewards ?
3) How much load/pressure jarek is in? 
4) Who is handling finances of the whole project and whats the health look like finances wise considering work for another 2 years remaining to complete roadmap?
5) Where is @CardanoThor ? 
I am not a person to far cry and scream on failures. But we need empathic and realistic communication going , the first thing is to accept that yes we have been delayed, whatever circumstances were. But we are heading down and working still. Forgetting everything and we are still working with some objective is what i want to hear

Just to let you know, finance-related questions were not answered, and we won't address them as they involve internal information. 
Regarding the question about the load or pressure Jarek is experiencing, I mentioned it's a personal question. But, I can share my personal experience that working in startups, in general, is stressful. I can attest to that working in startups since 2019
baba — 7/25/2024 12:06 PM
Ok. But concern is on the development velocity side. We are seeing delays after suggesting multiple times that “hard work is done, its should be easy to roll out features” and this is becoming endless wait for feature rollouts. Needless to mention, we are loosing competitive advantage with time being so ahead in industry. If features are rolled out, we have enough community members to push for marketing and integration. But we need to have feature completeness
I am ok to be delayed, but communication and transparency is the key in building trust in the situation we are now. Transparency wudnt matter earlier, but it matters now IMO

I didn’t hear all of the community call, but the part I listened to it seems that after the Chang hardfuck it will be impossible to MM if we are little fish, because the fees for MM will be a lot higher. Is that it?
Serotonin — 7/25/2024 9:28 PM
No, I don't think so. Fees are paid by the taker, so if your strategy is always the maker then I don't think it will matter.  All fees on Cardano will go up. But tbh I was kind of in and out so I might have missed something.
Oli — 7/26/2024 1:17 AM
Not sure what you want as an answer on "why are things delayed". If something is delayed it means we worked on something else in the meantime. Focus now is removing pain points of our current platform, releasing performance upgrades, UX/UI improvements and adding the community suggestions. 
Oli — 7/26/2024 1:19 AM
I'm also curious to see how this will develop across the whole eco system.

But since the fees for ref scripts  is something all dapps on cardano will have, everybody suffers from this, especially the user making a swap and paying a higher fee.

Wonder if IOG has something in mind to lower the fees in general and make it more user friendly
Marked Safe From Titan — 7/26/2024 4:35 AM
Makes a lot of sense to raise fees before we on board defi users. Cardano is competing with eth L2s essentially and their fees are pennies. Carbonzo is dead
Oli — 7/26/2024 4:52 AM
Jarek mentioned in the call that IOG would not provide information as to why they did this, unless you sign an NDA and don't talk publicly about it 🤷‍♂️ 

It does seem that AXO will be less affected than other DEXes that use the batcher model, so that's a good thing
Oli — 7/26/2024 4:57 AM
I would also argue that ETH L2s concentrated on being cheap and fast, but not decentralized, with the backdoors and admin keys etc. 
Though I also see that most people don't care about that :shrug:
Marked Safe From Titan — 7/26/2024 5:11 AM

Oli — 7/26/2024 5:12 AM

Marked Safe From Titan — 7/26/2024 5:15 AM

Oli — 7/26/2024 5:22 AM
That's one way to put it yes
dannycemilha — 7/26/2024 6:09 AM
So eventually can we say it could be less fees for MM on Axo after the hardfuck?
Sammy — 7/26/2024 7:06 AM
To be fair, the question was mainly how many are left working, not who left/was let go for what reasons. Those reasons are uninteresting. We are not about gossip here
Abd121 — 7/26/2024 7:52 AM
I suppose a it's better to assume good faith with questions and answer based on that version of them. even if we think the one asking is being malicious, since it'd be addressing everyone in general and clarifying positions as opposed to responding to the attacker specifically.
Sammy — 7/26/2024 8:16 AM
its not only mine, it is what was actually asked and desired to be known. yes, some did phrase it differently and more harshly but not the majority of us. I have only seen Oli and/or you make it about whatever reasons there were for developers to leave. again, reasons are uninteresting and irrelevant

as for the teampage, yes, just as you say, no one cared and would continue to not care about the teampage if you provided information on how many people are left working on your project. 
only after becoming starved for real information did people turn to the teampage and how see how out of date it is, which of course made it worse

this chapter of drama is on you
Marked Safe From Titan — 7/26/2024 9:55 AM
Things investors don't care about; team members are leaving for natural reasons. Things we rightfully care about; team members leaving cause of change of vision or leadership. It's very pertinent to our investment especially given the speed of fixes and road map implementations
Oli — 7/26/2024 10:12 AM
Form what I've seen, no one has left for the reason you mentioned. I explained already the one dev that left recently was because he is a hardcore Haskell dev and wants to do just that. He received an offer for a better position as a team leader of a Haskell dev team.
Definitely good to see people do good in their career
Abd121 — 7/26/2024 10:22 AM
So I suppose this is a confirmation that the current page is correct as of now?
Oli — 7/26/2024 10:23 AM
No it's not correct, once our main FE dev is back we'll have the page updated
Just wanted to shine some light about "people leaving because change of vision and leadership" 
There are also (from what I can see) no employees, but only contractors, which is typical for startups and remote jobs
I haven't worked as an employee in the multiple startups I've been part of. I think it's just too difficult to handle employment, taxes, social security for different countries for worldwide people, just a mess
Abd121 — 7/26/2024 10:27 AM
from what I seeing from this whole "dev leaving discorse" this is what seems to be the catalyst for the questions
I know a lot of the devs who used to do contract work for AXO, people are seeing their contract ends so they're now wondering who is still there and who didn't renew post launch.
Oli — 7/26/2024 10:30 AM
From what I can see it's just fud from one person, in the way he phrases things, making it look one way while that's not true
To be fair, in my experience, contractors change constantly. Not many ppl stay longer than 1-2 yrs in the same project, and imo they shouldn't. You're almost always better off job hopping, getting experience somewhere and then better position and pay somewhere else, in comparison to staying in the same company for 10 yrs
I just signed a contract for a new client yesterday, and they also don't have a teams page up for that reason. People work on a project, once it's done they move on. I don't see it differently at AXO or any startup for that matter
Sammy — 7/26/2024 10:40 AM
From what I can see it's just fud from one person

I can assure you, its not just one person. The FUD, perhaps...
Oli — 7/26/2024 10:44 AM
From what I can see from this convo, is that you would like to know how many ppl are currently working for AXO, right?
Sammy — 7/26/2024 10:46 AM
Oh, am I the fudder you're referring to?
Oli — 7/26/2024 10:47 AM

Just want to see exactly what info you want, and I'll see to get it
Sammy — 7/26/2024 10:50 AM
Yes, I do want to know how many are still working on Axo at the moment 
Oli — 7/26/2024 10:51 AM
Got it, I'll see to get that info, though I just want to express again these numbers change rapidly, some things might be outsourced as well, the actual number doesn't say that much in general
I also received several DMs from people interested in joining and helping out with some stuff, again on short-term contractor/commission basis
sbjuice — 7/26/2024 11:12 AM
To me it seems like axo and you are just beating around the bush in answering the actual number because of the optics. Fine they were contractors we get it but it is getting clearer and clear that answering this question is difficult for you for reasons beyond just not knowing the numbers. If they were contractors then own it and say there are no devs at this time. We are hiring.  Beating around the bush on this topic is why people keep fuding. Yes if you give us the answer and it's not great we will have to deal with it.   Like you said start up.
Oli — 7/26/2024 11:34 AM
But there's like 5 devs or something 😅 plus the rest of the team, I just haven't bothered counting everyone in the team because I have no idea why this conversation is such a big thing, I personally didn't give it any thought and thought the discussion closed
I really don't understand why you guys are so fixated on that
To me it all started with the fud and now we're here
When I use a product, I care about the product on how it benefits me and how I can use it. I very rarely care about the team, hence one more reason why I thought we moved on from this convo when we had it last time and I shed llight on it
Sammy — 7/26/2024 11:41 AM
it is as baba put it here: ⁠🐒-mal-og-crib⁠

Axo is not finished. It is not a finished product. This is exactly why it absolutely is a concern whether enough people are working on it or not 
Oli — 7/26/2024 11:42 AM
No one arguing that, hence why the short term priorities are finishing what we have, removing pain points, improving UI/UX, adding community suggestions we received (over 100) 
Improving performance, get ready for a stressful hard fork
TStorms — 7/26/2024 11:43 AM
Pretty important to know what the staff of a company that you invested in looks like.
This started out as a normal question, but was interpreted as Fud. Easiest way to deal with Fud is to show the truth. Updating the page seems like minimal effort, so we’re surprised it hasn’t happened yet
Oli — 7/26/2024 11:43 AM

Sammy — 7/26/2024 11:43 AM
so are you confused about us wanting to know those things?
Oli — 7/26/2024 11:44 AM
Yes I am, but I'll try to get that info, even though it will change rapidly and I hope we can close this chapter
And then move on and stop wasting each other's time
Oli — 7/26/2024 11:45 AM
The original question was not how many people are currently working at AXO, let's be honest with this
The question was why people are leaving and how many left the company
And that's what we addressed
TStorms — 7/26/2024 11:46 AM
The Q was how up to date the genlambda page was. The fact that Finley asked it made you think it was Fud.
Either way the solution was to take 10mins to update the page and prevent hours of useless chatter and more potential Fud
Oli — 7/26/2024 11:47 AM
No that was only part of the question
Sammy — 7/26/2024 11:47 AM
how many are left and how many left are two sides of one thing: the team size
Oli — 7/26/2024 11:47 AM
But I would prefer we can stop talking about whatever we both think and see differently. I'll see to get a number for you guys

Is that okay?
It's just a waste of time and different interpretations and what I read seems not to be what you read

Is this really the protocol u imagined launching?  I invested pre sale because it was brought up before launch that cardano liquidity issues aren't a concern for axo because ob is so efficient. Concerns about axo being too advanced we're dismissed and everyone got wrecked at launch trying to do their part and mm being told pnl and easy strats soon. 7 months later no real docs and the only reason regular users are mm is because @Serotonin is such a superstar. 7 months after launch and the protocol feels like a beta compared to what we were told it would be.
Makes me sad I'm the one speaking on this mostly because so many og's have been silenced/ gone away
sbjuice — 7/26/2024 3:19 PM
I vote to pay @Serotonin. give him the info and he will crush it. You need documents and can't do it internally. let him into the inner circle. hire community and you will have buy-in. we are all using his starts over AXO's anyway. this way maybe some successful strats will make some money and you can release PnL and profitable strats can be seen.

Cardano liquidity issues were brought up multiple times before launch. Hell even a dummy like me asked if it would be an issue that cardano has few users and liquidity. Now it's a surprise?
Marked Safe From Titan — 7/26/2024 5:00 PM
The same cardano from pre launch when we were told axo would shine no matter what since it was light years ahead of anything in crypto. Now we're begging for the simplest of things and seeing the design constantly questioned. I've said my peace. Serotonin should get paid tho

We have competition developing
And we are now, how i see it in a “management mess” 

Anyways, we need to push keeping head down with empathy @glewellin 

We wont achieve anything saying things about cardano. Let liquidity and limit orders be the problem. Lets just do feature completeness pls
We all are aware, cardano is joke from defi, liquidity or capital perspective
Feature completeness gives us things to migrate elsewhere
We (both sides) achieve nothing but frustrations asking questions and giving justifications
baba — 7/26/2024 5:13 PM
We have to accept the launch was botched launch. There were expectations which are not fulfilled yet 
And tone down our choice of words when we talk of anything outside axo.
If we ourselves not worthy enough to use our funds in efficient way on axo. Thn what we will talk about cardanos defi and efficiency
Serotonin — 7/27/2024 3:41 PM
So, this is this stuff that I and others have been trying to get Axo to push for a long time. Other protocols are essentially begging to be able to provide liquidity and incentivize liquidity on Axo, but there aren’t market making strategies available for them and there isn’t any way to calculate or distribute rewards to their users who do provide liquidity on Axo.
Image
So it’s great that we got them on our side for the launchpad, but it’s also kind of putting the cart before the horse if they have to send everything over to AMMs to make things work.
Serotonin — 7/27/2024 3:50 PM
Thanks, I really appreciate it, but I really don’t have the time to be able to do all of this along with my 9-5 job, Indigo PWG tasks, the ASS, and family time. I might write down some notes of things I’ve learned while designing strategies, but it would be at my own pace. As far as other strategies themselves, I’ll tinker and come up with what I can, but nothing I can do will make new macros or other features come any faster that are needed to build more complex strategies.
Marked Safe From Titan — 7/27/2024 3:52 PM

U deserve payment but maybe at the very least they give u any tool u need to aid ur strategy journey
sbjuice — 7/27/2024 4:28 PM
Of course I didn't think you would take on the job but I think they should take notice that a community member created the most successful strats not them. It's clear they can't do it themselves. Not sure why.

 MM is the main selling point or atleast was for axo. Giving someone the tools and letting them in to the fine details is the only way they will get it done. Just being realistic. If it wasn't for you and a few others. No one would be MM. They failed I'm sorry and need to pivot their management style on getting people docs and understandable strats. You made what a strat a month? That's the KPI of the new person the decide to pay. Basically everything you have been doing for free. They should be the ones taking notes.
Sorry again for bringing you into this but I think it's important and they should be learning. This is why so many are pissed we don't have more. You did what you did with a little research and the little time you have. They have "7" axo employees and can't do it. I'm sorry they should be embarrassed. Get rid of Thor and find a Ser. Money well spent.

I agree with Serotonin; we need some MM for this pair and guidance from Axo to the Dedium team so they can provide their liquidity. If it weren't for some of us providing liquidity, we wouldn't have any volume, and this is just sad since we had the launchpad on Axo.
Marked Safe From Titan — 7/28/2024 8:25 AM
Not a good look. Seemed like the whole point of the launchpad was to on-board pol from teams and we have nothing for them after the sale? What a misstep

Why not just use the amm strat for starters
dannycemilha — 7/28/2024 9:12 AM

TStorms — 7/28/2024 9:12 AM
This is all behind the scenes, so people here don’t know that it’s happening.  It’s easier for people to extrapolate from Axo’s launch that underdelivered with regard to their expectations
I’m sorry for the position you’re currently in @glewellin . I really hope a few positive improvements will help change the sentiment and make it more fun to keep working on Axo while gaining some support from the community
TStorms — 7/28/2024 9:16 AM
I didn’t expect Axo to fall below private sale price, and expected an easier experience for users with some more documentation laid out
Fair point
dannycemilha — 7/28/2024 9:18 AM
Usually on other dexs when the launchpad finish the liquidity is added right after. I assumed that we had that figure it out. But I guess the next launchpad will be better. Or at least I hope so.
TStorms — 7/28/2024 9:19 AM
Yeah this is brutal
dannycemilha — 7/28/2024 9:22 AM
I agree that is was not bad, at least to me. The only thing I can conplain about is the lack of liquidity on Axo right afetr the sale ended.
And perhaps a plan to incentivize  the liquidity as MinSwap just did, offering Min rewards.
And we are doing that? Or they didn't wanted?

Okay, thanks. I'm a happier man now.

ADA really shucks. I kinda agree to the comment that “ada is hated outside as well as inside” 😫
There has been no successful project in cardano space to outperform ada in relative terms. There is none. Therefore cardano shucks
Marked Safe From Titan — 7/28/2024 1:07 PM
Ada issues were known before launch. We were told axo would perform well regardless. Funny this exist has started now

So what are the solutions. Blaming cardano price its difficultty for developers, its users, meme coins  doesn't solve anything. What are the solutions to these problems specifically for axo. Or are we accepting defeat
Serotonin — 7/28/2024 2:16 PM
Ideally, I'd like to see additional Xlang/Strategy Builder features that would make it much easier to post multiple orders onto the books. I don't know if it's possible to make it so that multiple orders could be posted from a single node or if it's a baked in requirement that you physically separate the orders. But something like doing a (s [tranche1, tranche2, tranche3], $ [price1, price2, price3]) would be much more convenient than having to build out 3 separate branches in an algorithm. This would make it much easier to post multiple bids/asks on the orderbook simultaneously so that people can see all of the liquidity (without having to relegate all of the liquidity into a single bid/ask order pair). Regardless of the specifics of how it's done, the bottom line is that we need actual "market maker" strategies that put a lot of liquidity visibly on the orderbook at more than one depth. The majority of MM and LP is typically actually done by relatively few individuals, so we can't rely on a ton of small MM to post lots of smaller strategies to fill the books (especially when there are other problems regarding fees for small MM).
Obviously, PnL and rewards/farms is another big part because we have to have a way for MM on Axo to be competitive with other protocols that provide rewards and allow dual farms. It's never going to be "easier" to MM on Axo than on AMMs. We can get it close and make it easy enough, but we will still need incentives in order to actually steal liquidity from competing protocols (and some will never migrate because it is either sticky or PoL by the other protocols). 
Philippe Le Long — 7/28/2024 6:17 PM
Significant changes in the cost model with Chang?
Philippe Le Long — 7/28/2024 6:33 PM
That's quite a lot. Will the cost increase be similar for AMM DEXes? This seems excessive tbh. Is there a public place where this is being discussed?
Philippe Le Long — 7/28/2024 7:08 PM
What Cardano needs, and I hope this will improve drastically under Voltaire, is direct input from actual builders and core development from within the community. This already improved a lot since Plutus V1 was released and Voltaire could give those community builders a real mandate and funding. 
Governance could be Cardano's turning point – in either direction. I 'm feeling optimistic and curious enough to still hold a good bag of ADA (that I could sell without loss). 
Despite some of Cardano's shortcomings, most other chains have so little in common with the core crypto values that made me interested in crypto in the first place that I would probably leave the space as a whole and focus on other hobbies.
Suratay — 7/29/2024 12:59 AM
Yes for AMMs aswell. For everyone who uses references scripts. To use reference scripts is pretty much for free now and but it will cost something after Chang HF

Hey guys, GM 👋 

Quick question for everyone: we received feedback to change the number notation across the platform. Currently, thousands are shown as "1.61166k". 

What would your preferred number notation be? 1.61k? 1611.66? 
What about 161.234k? Hundred of thousands? 
What about millions? How many decimals? 
Abd121 — 8/1/2024 3:12 AM
"1.61166k" is going into the sub 1 decimal units. I would say a sliding scale is better? like 1.6k is good, but 52462.6k is kind of pointless to include the decimal at that point? just how including a 0.000xx number into a single digit thousand is. ()

I prefer a max of 5 digits, including 2 decimal places. For example 111.11 and 1.11k for 1,111.11

laddered orders
@Serotonin
you think we can have 3 ladder orders on each side on the VOB to reduce the chances of being the taker?
Serotonin — 8/14/2024 4:41 PM
Depends on the strategy. The CPMM that I’m hoping to release has 3 on each side, but for some reason the orders disappeared from the VOB after a while (no idea why, nothing should have been updated). I might have to add some checks to it, but when I tried it wouldn’t build because the strategy was too large. This means I’ll either have to find somewhere else to slim down the strategy size or make it only 2 on each side.
Hence my ⁠No Access post
With a Rolling Grid many of the aspects are less complex so I think I’ll be able to do 3-5 pairs of orders at a time. Yet to be seen though
Lifeless Ditto — 8/14/2024 4:44 PM

I really doubt going with ML labs is a smart choice. After all we didnt want to contract development out of house and prevent plagiarism
Why sudden turn of events?
Many teams have been burned to death by contracting to MLlabs. Where cost becomes the factor and MLlabs keeps it incomplete delivery due to cost factor
Oli — 8/18/2024 6:58 AM
Hmmm really?
The thing is, from what I understand from previous messages, is that a Haskell dev is not persé good at coding Plutus/plutarch etc. It actually takes a lot of time and effort to bring a Haskell dev, even if senior, up to date with how Cardano works

Mlabs is specialized in Cardano Haskell stuff, so the on-boarding is much shorter

Also the Axo lead Haskell dev is now a team lead at Mlabs, which makes it easier to onboard them to work on the Axo protocol 
I don't know about pricing etc, and I haven't really heard anything negative about them (also didn't hear anything positive though, just neutral)

Oli — 8/26/2024 3:13 PM
It's on my to do list to ask the team about this, just everyone is quite busy right now and we wouldn't be able to really have this conversation
But I would love that yes.... Haven't talked to Serotonin or the team yet about this, but it would be nice to hire Sero to create some kind of basket for MM, even though I know he has a very busy life juggling work, family and axo 

Discussion on this coming soon though 👍 I'll get over my whole AXO to do list soon (it keeps growing 😆 )

For Dedium, they found it a bit difficult and daunting, even though we provided all explanations and even video guides on how to set it up, but they also really want the rewards system to be live to incentivize MMers on Axo before putting some PoL

With Strike, they are interested in running MM strats with 10-20% of what will be used as liquidity, so hopefully it can be done much quicker after the sale has ended
Oli — 8/26/2024 3:13 PM
Yes, that would be the easiest at first
Marked Safe From Titan — 8/26/2024 3:18 PM

Oli — 8/26/2024 3:19 PM
Strike said they want to put 10-20%, so that should be okay

Dedium will also put 5-10% once rewards are live
That usually, like you say, is all we need to stay competitive compared to AMMs 
Marked Safe From Titan — 8/26/2024 3:21 PM

Oli — 8/26/2024 3:29 PM
Partly our fault for not being there enough to guide them early on, gotta take some blame for that... But we learn as we go, we did adjust a lot of things to the launchpad as well after the DEDI sale
Serotonin — 8/26/2024 3:43 PM
Not sure if the CPMM would be the best option. Unfortunately, it looks like I can only get 2 pairs of bud/ask orders to post at a time before it hits the strategy size limit. So they would probably need to deploy multiple copies (possibly with different trance scales) to have a decent number of bids/asks on the books.

I’ve got another type of grid strategy designed (similar to the Rolling Grid) but haven’t been able to test it out yet since testnet strategies can’t be created as of the Chang HF thing. Certainly, won’t be able to have it ready for after the launch in 48 hrs
But, at least it’s letting me create 3 pairs of bids/asks on that strategy in the composer. I haven’t tried to see how many I can fit before it yells at me.
Oli — 8/26/2024 3:58 PM
I really hope we will have time soon to go over your strats, with dedicated time just for this, to figure out what can be done about this
maybe something wrong in the strat, maybe we can add something in xlang, just something to get your strats ready
Serotonin — 8/26/2024 4:27 PM
One thing that would help is this ⁠No Access
I might be able to suggest other things as well, but it would require me knowing a bit more about how things work under the hood. Like, I don’t know what the scope of the functions that you make is. For instance, I’ll create a function that calculates and returns an ask price. If I call this function 5 times, I don’t know if it runs the calculation 5 times on chain (wasting compute) or if it runs it once and caches the value for the next times that it is called within that block. 
Oli — 8/26/2024 4:31 PM

Serotonin — 8/26/2024 7:50 PM
But hey, maybe I should start charging these project who want to launch on Axo for services to design MM strategies 😆 . You can either build your own or pay me for the low fee of X and I'll create a strategy for you.

havent followed your strats @Serotonin in the last couple month. Could you give me an update which ones are the way to go atm if i want to provide single sided liquidity and for a pair i expect some larger movements?
and have you ran some of your strats through Pandas little programm to see the PnL?
Serotonin — 8/30/2024 9:32 AM
Hey, it’s been a while since I’ve published anything new, I’m still waiting for testnet to be fully functional after the Chang upgrade they did to be able to finish up a couple that I’m working on rn.

The Rolling Grid works best for single sided liquidity and can also be good for larger price movements if you use a small tranche size to allow for a large number of grid lines. The 50-50 CPMM works good for large price movements too and is slightly easier perhaps to setup. Both of those had a vulnerability that was identified about a month ago, so I recommended that people stop using them. Finley published a new variant of the Rolling Grid that has a quick fix for the vulnerability. A quick fix could be done for the CPMM as well, although, the new version is so close to being done (that will have more asks/bids on the VOB at once as well) that it’s probably worth it to just wait until testnet gets updated and go with the new version
The other one I’m working on that’s on testnet is sort of a variant of the Rolling Grid/GridMM that’s a bit easier to deploy (or rather to know where it will operate).
The quick fix Rolling Grid is here if you want to use it.

And unfortunately, I haven’t gotten around to using Pando’s  program to get PnL on a number of different strategies. I just did a before/after on a couple that were easy enough to see what the persons starting allocations were
They’re definitely profitable compared to an AMM but the market has been so bad lately it’s harder to find ones that beat out simply holding due to the IL/IR
Suratay — 8/30/2024 12:45 PM

Serotonin — 8/31/2024 8:27 PM
What are you trying to do? If you'd like I can try and prioritize the grid strategy over the CPMM if you're looking to do single sided liquidity or more concentrated liquidity that isn't at 50-50

I think I've got the strategy down, but testnet is still bugging out and won't complete trades. They're even showing up under "Market trades" but nothing appears in the strategy trade history and then when I have to eject them the strategies are returned with their original assets, so no transactions appear to be going through.

Marked Safe From Titan — 9/2/2024 2:12 PM
Kinda funny it seemed like the alliance protocols were struggling the most with Chang
Serotonin — 9/2/2024 9:24 PM
I'm going to wait to hear back on something first. I'm getting weird behavior where it posts orders to the VOB, but then for some reason won't let them be filled by a limit order at times. I'm not sure if it's some weird compute limit thing (the strategy re-posts the same orders if you cancel the limit order) or just something odd with testnet or what
And ofc, I wouldn't mind and would give it a go if it didn't cost almost 70 ADA just to build the thing on mainnet 😂
So I don't want to waste ADA deploying a completely broken strat
Suratay — 9/3/2024 12:12 AM
Oh 😂 didn’t know it’s that expensive.
Let’s better keep testing it on testnet 😅
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 8:57 AM
Yea it seems to start at 50 Ada and increase with size. I have a habit of basically maxing out the size to try and fit as many asks/bids in the same strategy as possible
Although, most, if not all, of the issues I’m seeing don’t happen if there is a single bid/ask pair in the strategy
So, if you want to sponsor one of those I can publish it so that you can get started using it.
Or I could send you an “export” and you could publish it yourself
Marked Safe From Titan — 9/3/2024 9:11 AM
U should start a tip wallet sero. I'll gladly throw some to help ur tests
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 9:24 AM
Yea, that’s not so much the issue as it is that the strategies seem “almost ready” all the time but something just won’t work quite perfectly. Typical development overconfidence I guess.
Like, I could have (and in hindsight probably should have) published fixed versions of the Rolling Grid and CPMM a couple of days after the vulnerability was found. I was expecting things to “just work” when copying new asks/bids as it has in other strategies, but the addition of the partition seems to have introduced some other side effects. I wasn’t expecting to run out of compute so soon (still not sure if that’s the issue), then I wasn’t expecting the to_64b_ratio function to behave oddly, then I wasn’t expecting for the strategy size limit to be hit so soon, then I wasn’t expecting Chang to mess up publishing on testnet, then… 😂 
Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 11:10 AM

I'm out rn, will send in like 6 hours
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 11:52 AM
What all do you want me to publish?  Options are:
Patched CPMM w/ 1 ask/bid
Patched CPMM w/ 2 ask/bid (may stall?)
Linear Grid w/ 1 ask/bid
Linear Grid w/ 4 asks/bids (may stall?)
I haven’t gotten around to re-designing the Rolling Grid yet. Linear Grid is somewhat similar, though there are some differences. TLDR is in Rolling Grid you specify tranche size while in Linear Grid you specify the end price points. 
But the quick-fix patch for Rolling Grid is already published 
In Linear Grid you specify a min_price, max_price, and number of grid lines to deploy liquidity. Grid lines are linearly spaced (vs a fixed % above/below in Rolling Grid). The tranche size is dependent on the total liquidity so you don’t specify that.
It’s easier to know what the bounds you will provide liquidity at, but it does make it quite confusing as to what price you’ll deploy your liquidity at for a given ratio of assets. The only ones that are “easy” are single sided liquidity (one grid line above min_price/below max_price) and 50:50 liquidity (one grid line above/below the mid point price)
Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 12:36 PM
for the 4th option, is the linear grid the one with 4 orders (2 pairs of ask/bid) or 8 orders?
I am thinking of the 4th one since you can do stableswaps easier
since more liquidity is posted, it will help for more orders to be routed through AXO
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 12:58 PM
4 pairs* Up to 8 orders, 4 asks and 4 bids 
Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 1:13 PM
0.o
and it stalls?
this would be good for stableswaps
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 1:23 PM
On testnet sometimes the limit orders don’t go through. Haven’t pinned down why. I thought it was when filling 3-4 orders at once, but it has stalled with just a single order being filled depending on the size of the limit order and the size of the ask on the VOB

I can double check, but I don’t think it stalls with just a single bid/ask pair. Unless the limit order is way above the current price, in which case I think it fills as many orders as it can before it runs out of compute.
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 2:00 PM
Well, fuck. It sounds like we won’t be getting the strategies with more than 1 bid/ask pair functioning anytime soon.
I thought once an order was posted to the VOB it could be filled immediately. Seems like the way things were designed, XLang validates each of the swaps within a strategy separately and the condition for the first swap needs to still be valid for the subsequent swaps to occur.
So basically, my strategies are trying to update the condition for what should happen after the first ask/bid occurs before the 2nd/3rd/4th bids/asks are filled and it’s throwing everything into an endless loop
Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 2:06 PM
ah
well
no use posting it then
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 2:07 PM
Sucks because this really limits what all can be displayed on the VOB. Nearly all of my strategies are forced to be iceberg strategies
Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 2:08 PM
@Oli plz fix
thx
having iceberg strats is not good if you want more trades to be routed through AXO
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 2:09 PM
There are a couple of workarounds I can think of, but they involve a little more complexity and require the 0.5Ada (probably more after Chang) update fee

Is it possible to do nested strategies?
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 2:10 PM
It’s in my long list of requested features, but no. I think that’s a bit more complicated compared to some of the other things I’ve requested.
Nested strategies. The ability for one strategy to update the parameters of another (like an on/off switch, fees, etc.)
Composable strategies essentially
Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 2:12 PM

Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 8:03 PM
are you testing it rn?
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 8:05 PM
Yeah, I'm finally able to see some of the other oddities of the strategy design come into play
So like, I'm basically actually spoofing the other asks/bids
it actually ends up canceling the other orders and re-calculating the price of the lowest ask/highest bid and will then fill that multiple times within the block
And there is a discrepancy between what my initial estimate amount is vs what the updated amount is. (which is why I can tell which "version" of the order is being filled) 
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 8:17 PM
"within the block." Like, it still ends up being maker, but for whatever reason on testnet transaction that I assume should be within a block seem to take well over a block time
Image
Looks like it goes back to looping after the initial 3 that are on the orderbook are filled
Image
Alright, whatever, let me see if I can get it to work with 4 pairs instead of 3. Either way, I'll post one soon.
Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 8:24 PM
nice
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 8:24 PM
So yea, not ideal given that with enough grid lines and/or a large enough limit order your strategy and the limit order can get locked in a loop and not fill until one of you cancels the order
esp for the general UX
Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 8:24 PM

Anso thinking USDM DJED for linear grid
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 8:27 PM
That will work. Though, honestly, a Dumb Grid or Grid MM would work just as well. You don't really need that many grid lines for stable swaps
Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 8:29 PM
I would say it might only need it during volatile periods
and this doesn't consume credits right?
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 8:30 PM
Nope, shouldn't consume credits
Generally speaking. There might be a chance it could be taker. And for some reason on testnet it was charged 0.35 ADA the first transaction..not sure what that's about
Image
but there isn't a 0.5 ADA update cost like with the Rolling Grid
Lifeless Ditto — 9/3/2024 8:35 PM
With the dumb grid it acts like an iceberg
While the linear shows more of it's orders
So more orders should be routed through AXO
I'd say 1000 USD should be enough to route these orders if it's even
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 8:48 PM
No, dumb grid shows everything
you just can only have up to 5 pairs of bids/asks
6 pairs with GridMM
Both of them act quirky though if you try to add assets to a strategy. You have to just completely re-deploy
Honestly, I should just make a smarter dumb grid. People probably won't have a problem deploying 3 or 4 copies if it's way easier to set them up.
And that way everything shows up on the books
Serotonin — 9/3/2024 9:04 PM

Serotonin — 9/4/2024 9:54 PM
@Lifeless Ditto I think I've got the Linear Grid working with a single bid/ask. Is that worth publishing for you or would you rather something with multiple bid/ask pairs?
Lifeless Ditto — 9/5/2024 8:04 AM
Multiple would be better
I wonder if there is a condition for the strategies where you can set (do not post if taker)

Twitter•9/5/2024 12:43 PM
U seen this?
Serotonin — 9/5/2024 2:13 PM
I saw him comment in ASB
Pi is also saying that it’s not really a node problem
I only half agree with this; They are correct in that there is no convenient endpoint that surfaces this information directly; that's not an issue, it's just that the node wasn't designed to be a platform that dApps build on, it was designed to serve the role of producing and propagating blocks. That's why TxPipe is building Dolos. So, it's a feature that would make our lives easier, but it's not an issue/bug.

Additionally, the node does expose sufficient information for this; you have access to the current ledger state, and the mempool, and it's a little inconvenient to derive your own "mempool aware state", but it's not impossible.
the node has a miniprotocol to return the chaintip state; and they have a way to return the transactions in the mempool; but, for example, there's no way to query "tell me the list of UTXOs / registered stake address / etc as of tip + all the mempool transactions applied"; you have to derive that state yourself
Then Ilya from Splash said that they are 100% using mini protocols “The problem is not in the absence of some functionality…ut in a rate at which localtxsubmission miniprotocol can process txs”
Pi: “my understanding is that localtxsubmission blocks until there is space in the mempool; so if you're facing this, it's because the mempool is full.”
“not trying to throw you under the bus btw, I totally understand the pain of building directly with the miniprotocols etc; and I'm really excited for what dolos provides.

Just not sure I agree with classifying it as "an issue with the node"”
Ilya asked what Dolos was
Then Pi answered

TxPipe are building a piece of software that acts like a node to the network, implementing a lot of the n2n miniprotocols, but notably:
1) doesn't perform consensus; so you point it at trusted peers;
2) doesn't produce blocks;
3) does index the ledger state in a way that is more optimized for common dApp queries, and provides more modern / portable APIs like gRPC, etc.

By doing this, it runs in 1% of the resource requirements of a full node, and can better serve the needs of dApps

I just looked through a bunch of $axo.treasury strats that are running for months now and dozens of them dont have traded at all besides a couple trades in like 3 month. Wouldnt it be better to re-allocate those funds into more active/newer strats? More active token pairs? Wouldnt it be more effective to focus on like a few of the top trading ada/cnt pairs and provide more capital in those pairs with tighter spreads so we do get back to some volume? i mean we are live for 9 month now and we had exactly 3 weeks of tight spreads with decent trading activity and after taking those strats down it was said they will be back up in a few days. That has never happened tho @Oli @glewellin 
Lifeless Ditto — 9/28/2024 4:51 PM
I say focusing on stable swaps strategies is a priority
There is less chance of there being an adverse movement that causes whipsaw actions that drains the treasury
I'd say just copy @Serotonin on stable swaps on USDM/DJED, USDM/IUSD, and IUSD/DJED
like the linear grid
20-30% of the treasury should be allocated in those stableswaps, since it is lower risk. More bots would probably come just to arb
Another one could be oADA/ADA, which hilariously would result in the DH/Splash Cabal scramming to find a way to make AXO swaps even worse
Serotonin — 9/28/2024 9:22 PM
I doubt you can make a strategy that can compete with Splash's tight AMM curve. Even if you set 0 spread the taker fees + Splash subsidizing their fees + how DH calculates things + RFT complaints (so no DH trades under 100 ADA) would mean that it probably wouldn't get any action. They created a Minswap ADA/OADA pool with 1M ADA TVL and it's getting no volume.

It's the only way to change oada to ada. They also pull the lp every end of epoch cause the voting rights of the ada has been auctioned. I'm guessing they pull any profits from pool fees at that time to give to soada stakers

This was also posted in the Atala Discord, and forwarded in the ASB Telegram: 

Hello everyone, 

I wanted to share some important updates regarding the Atala team and the future of the Hyperledger Identus Project. 

IOG has recently undergone a restructuring that has significantly impacted the Atala team. Unfortunately, the majority of Atala, including all members of the Product team— Fay and myself included—have been let go. However, IOG has expressed commitment to continue the Hyperledger Identus Project. A small group of team members will be transitioning to Input Output Engineering (IOE) to maintain and advance the project. 

Regarding Atala products and Atala commercial pursuits, it's safe to assume they will not be developed. As of today, there are no details about the future of the PRISM Sandbox; I assume, at some point, updates will be shared. 

I also emphasize that any former IOG employee is free to decide whether they wish to remain engaged with Identus. If you choose not to continue your involvement, please let me know so I can update the Identus Maintainers List accordingly. 

I understand that this is a significant change and challenging times are coming, but this presents an opportunity for Identus to work more closely with the community, with more autonomy and freedom from IOG's internal processes.

Thank you for your dedication and commitment to the project.

Every project on Cardano works with a market maker if they’re listed on a CEX.

Why? Because they can't meet the volume requirements.

Now, it’s time for DEXs to have market makers too. That’s why we’re here. Our services are not for the public, but for projects.

⁠No Access he wants to stir the pot again...
Faketoshi — 10/8/2024 6:56 AM
Regarding your question for ideas ⁠No Access
With thin trading volume and shallow pools on Cardano, divided between 13 different DEX, an aggregator is essential or even unavoidable for the end user.
We know that DH has no good integration of AXO and a not so hidden bias in general towards other DEX's and a competition would be a healthy thing for the market overall.

I have talked with @Elder Millenial and he has expressed that he would like to work with AXO and be open to integrating steelswap into AXO.
Steelswap has good tech under the hood but lacks in UI. They would benefit greatly form the charts, statistics and general UI provided by AXO + more exposure to the end user.
AXO would benefit also because of the better integration that steelswap has for AXO orders and also benefit from traffic generated to the site (launchpad, general brand awareness) and perceived and tangible progress of AXO development in general, because it is a very user facing and visible change/improvement and not development under the hood.

Steelswap could replace the 'simple mode' and be integrated seamlessly in the UI.
The user and both parties would profit from this collaboration.
PS: Steelswap has CNT<->CNT trading, which is essential for stablecoins for example (iUSD-USDM) and stablecoins would be unbeatable on AXO - AMM pools are very inefficient in this field.
Currently is makes no sense to provide such liquidity on AXO because the traffic comes mainly via DH, which does not support CNT-CNT

dannycemilha — 10/8/2024 8:55 AM
After this happens we need the wallets, especially Vesper to integrate too, like they do for DH
Lifeless Ditto — 10/8/2024 9:10 AM
@glewellin I feel like we have a few strategies that would be useful for stableswaps. Particularly, @Serotonin 's recent strategies. Is it possible to have AXO focus on those instead of trying to do ADA/CNT? especially when AXO risks those projects pulling liquidity and causing issues (like BTN)
And will it be possible to have an API for integrating off chain bots? Genius Yield has a MM bot https://www.geniusyield.co/marketmakerbot?lng=en that users can use python to do. I would say this would allow for a stopgap measure while Xlang gets more polished
And people can have more complex trading strategies that is hidden, while also helping to pad the limit orders you guys will need to get on chain strategies working 
exkoltibur — 10/8/2024 11:02 AM
Wow nice stuff
Pushing steelswap would make a lot of sense since it is literally the only other real aggregator isnt it?

Suratay — 10/9/2024 8:15 AM
I don’t really see people trading bridged USDC tho, and bridged assets are always little less popular I guess. 

Maybe try to get some volume/attention first with USDM/iUSD/DJED before starting with bridged USDC 
And I also would not stop ADA/CNTs aswell but update the Strats to newer ones and maybe some with a tighter spread again (?) and focus more liquidity in the most popular pairs. Atm we have most Strats doing nothing for weeks and month or just having a couple trades. So they don’t really provide liquidity where it’s useful
Lifeless Ditto — 10/9/2024 8:33 AM
I would say for treasury allocation, less than 10% should be in bridged assets. 40% in stables, 20% reserve, and 30% in launchpad tokens & AXO
But I think that using existing DAO tools like clarity DAO, and asking the community to vote would encourage participation
https://www.clarity.vote/

Simple Web3 Organization Management
proposals such as voting on which token pair gets liquidity will result in more participation, this will be like Sundae's reward system
Lifeless Ditto — 10/9/2024 8:41 AM

volume is down overall, which is depressing. 
but what I know is that iUSD, USDM and DJED all have an expected value of $1, so having a stableswap is the less risky\

People want the usdc for liqwid but they hate the price impact so it could gain traction when people see how easy it is thru axo
Suratay — 10/9/2024 10:19 AM
I overall agree but would more say like:

40% Stables (including bridged assets)
40% 10 most traded CNTs over the last 30 Days
15% Reserve
5% AXO

But lets be honest - those are also just some numbers i came up with by thinking 3 minutes about it. Nothing i really thought about. 
Serotonin — 10/9/2024 10:43 AM
Do “people” really want USDC for Liqwid or is it just Liqwid taking loans on POL?

When I was in the dc a lot of people talked about the price impact keeping them from using it
Serotonin — 10/9/2024 10:46 AM
So someone has to bridge it first I guess.
Marked Safe From Titan — 10/9/2024 10:47 AM
That was the issue. They only bridged for liqwid and barely any for pools. Axo fixes this
Serotonin — 10/9/2024 10:47 AM
I put up a limit buy on AXO for USDC a while back and it got no bites.
So in order to MM you kinda need to first have some
Lifeless Ditto — 10/9/2024 12:55 PM
the question is whether the token holders have a long or short term outlook for the project
as staking would basically just be inflation for the sake of inflation
and it would actually pull away from MMs who provide liquidity to AXO/ADA
Gynopedie — 10/9/2024 12:58 PM
Maybe it can be mixed.  Like holding Axo or depositing it give you boosted rewards when MM.  Similar to Wing riders maybe?

dannycemilha — 10/11/2024 2:15 PM
One thing I remembered about the new innovations, ideas, etc. Is that we could have a page for swapping native BTC, ETH, and others for ADA by integrating MayaProtocol apy.
I saw that they integrated Radix a few days ago, and it works well. Made some swaps via ThorSwap and it was fast.
They are close to integrating Cardano, as they were funded by Catalyst, I think it’s a 2 to 3 months away.
This MayaProtocol is a fork of ThorChain where you can swap native BTC, ETH, USDC(Eth), USDC(arb) or others, and soon Cardano will be there. I think it could bring some liquidity and having a direct page on Axo to do it could bring some new liquidity.
For tax reasons I would use it before using CEXs and I think more people are in the same situation as me.
Marked Safe From Titan — 10/11/2024 2:24 PM

Off ramp don't know for sure. ThorChain is just a protocol to swap native crypto. You must be talking about ThorWallet maybe.

I've used ThorChain and MayaProtocol, never had to do kyc
dannycemilha — 10/11/2024 2:30 PM
And about the risk, if you integrate, you don't keep the assets, that's the job of ThorChain and MayaProtocol
so it's a win win
unless you deposit some of your asset in the pool you could have that risk
that's why they pay you a fee to have that risk
Image
when you swap BTC to Eth for example, itr's a 5 minute thing
and it's decentralize, that's the idea of this protocol

I'm not sure about the technicalities, but PnL should be out this month 👍 

For rewards, the system is built and I had the chance to test it in dev environment as well. The UI just didn't look great at all or easy to understand, so we need to change this before release. Also, we're thinking about bigger considerations like market impact, I hope I can share a positive update on this soon 👍

Yes, we need to make pretty big changes there. Right now, tokens are being sent out directly. We need to adjust the system to not do this until the minimum required amount is reached. This is mostly being done by our FE dev. It involves some xlang and changes in the way orders are created (extra settings to be added)

UX wise, nothing changes for the user, except they won't get the tokens directly, and they'll see all the information in the status bar

Dont you feel like that is the bare minimum of communication we have left atm?
Oli — 10/28/2024 3:20 AM
I think it's better to have it text-based, than a live call. The calls do serve the opportunity to connect with the community, but they aren't really fulfilling that need. Most users are looking more for concrete platform updates and feature roll-outs, rather than a general discussion. 

The last few calls were mostly just repeating information that was already shared through a discord announcement and tweet. So I would rather continue this way, to share updates as they come, when there is something substantial to share. Then the information is fresh and we avoid repetition. 

I'm thinking more to continue the updates as they come, and then compact it in a blog post to detail all the updates and accomplishments. This will include what users have been asking about the most, like PnL and rewards, on-going work with mlabs etc. 

Any questions you have can be asked on Discord and we will answer them quicker than waiting on a community call. Discord is great for direct interaction with the team, I don't think we need a live call for that. 

This approach is more efficient, it has on-demand updates and answers, which is good for transparency for everyone, including people who are not joining the calls. 

We can always have a live call when there is something substantial to share, but a fixed call doesn't bring anything good to the table. Users are interested in new features and updates and the calls don't give any alpha as everything is shared as it goes. Most of the calls are just reading what has already been announced.

I would like to have an aggregator directly on the Axo page that wouldn’t be bias as DexHunter for example.
I would like to have some strategies made by the team that could be used by everyone and wouldn’t rekt people, meaning that can’t be gamed like many were before.
I would like to have more Macros, that were promised by Jarek, ema, ma, etc, so we can use on the strategies.
I would like to have some strategies that were on the testnet in the beginning like the Trailing, Protected Bounded, etc.

Our friends got it already.
Remember that this Maya will integrate Cardano next 
And this is native BTC, ETH, etc.
WIth the new zkBTC from BitcoinOS that is coming it could bring a lot of arbitrage opportunity
Serotonin — 10/30/2024 8:56 AM
Do you know how long it takes to go to/from BTC to Cardano?
dannycemilha — 10/30/2024 9:09 AM
True, i forgot about that. 😅 But even though it would be good to open all this doors for Axo, do you agree?
Serotonin — 10/30/2024 9:21 AM
No, that was a genuine question. Idk much about BTCOS. But the point is that arbitrage opportunities depend on how easily/inexpensively/quickly you can go from one to the other. USDM, for example, is backed by USD but can’t hold peg because it takes 1+ days and >1% fees to go one way.
I’m trying to figure out if there’s something legitimately there or if it’s basically just another bridge that, while non-custodial, would essentially have the same results on Cardano as bridged USDC/etc. from Arbitrum
dannycemilha — 10/30/2024 9:24 AM
I think you could swap from ADA to BTC in 1 hour, not great
And for USDM I agree, I guess we must wait for USDA
My point also was about bringing liquidity from outside cardano and if we have a Axo on full potential it could bring some volume
At least more than we have right now
Serotonin — 10/30/2024 9:40 AM
Yeah, all I can do is wait and see. It seems like an endless carrot on a stick. Something is always new just around the corner that's going to bring Cardano back into the spotlight, but it's never what it was originally touted to be. I had high hopes for USDM, but there was far lower institutional interest out the gate than I expected (Idk what kind of problems they had at launch), months later it still isn't available to the public, there are bank fees, slow turnarounds, and not enough liquidity to do "slow" arbitrage.
And we could have "native BTC" on Cardano tomorrow, but idk what the demand would be like, both from BTC holders trying to use Defi or ADA holders wanting to use their BTC in defi
it seems to me that most BTC maxi's dislike Cardano (really almost everyone outside of Cardano) and ADA holders don't even use their ADA for Defi so why would they use their BTC for it?
relent7ess — 10/30/2024 9:49 AM
nomadusdc held pretty well until hack at least :x
i meant sensitivity to peg
dannycemilha — 10/30/2024 11:47 AM
About USDM, we could arbitrage via NBX when they open the gates, no?
dannycemilha — 10/30/2024 7:17 PM
Can we do something with this Axelar? What's the benefit for Cardanzo? Can it be used by Axo? Anybody know?
relent7ess — 10/30/2024 7:48 PM
its a pretty decent bridge that polkadot ecosystem uses alot
dannycemilha — 10/31/2024 3:28 AM
But it's mainly for axlUSD from what I've seen. I assume we should have a big pool of axlUSD on Cardano side.
The more bridges the better

Yea, he walked it back a bit when chicken offered to setup something with Adnan or the CTO. I’m reading it as there is still a question mark there, but could go either way.
Regardless, I don’t see any practical value from being able to ask Alexa to place an order for ETH for you.
Simple orders are a few clicks. Any moderately complicated strategy I would never trust an AI with.

It seems like they’re doing their IDO on Minswap. Until people dig deeper into it I’m okay with it not being on Axo. It might be sort of hyped, but reputation for launching legitimate projects is pretty important imo
Swordlash — 11/13/2024 10:01 AM
It's not a direct competitor unless they are able to execute logic directly on the core exchange, like Axo (without going through submitting things on chain every time). Otherwise anybody can just have an arbitrary external logic that pulls data and places/cancels orders

I think the market depth chart in encs coin is broken.
or they didn't do what they published. 
Serotonin — 11/19/2024 7:25 AM
It doesn’t rely on an external price oracle at all, so that shouldn’t be an issue. The more likely thing is that, it’s single sided liquidity that was deployed at 0.37. So it’s just going to sit there and do nothing if price goes down. Liquidity is deployed between 0.37 Ada and ~2.5 Ada ENCS price.
Serotonin — 11/19/2024 7:27 AM
It’s a rolling grid so only the ENCS that are on the current grid line are visible at a time

Well played…
Oli — 11/24/2024 3:12 AM
Don't take it personal... I removed the mod role for unactive people when I joined, left the role for active ppl which then quit due to private life stuff 
Could've even been removed from you before I joined, I have no recollection of your username tbh

I join the company, I become a mod, I need to ask who lost the mod role?

I can’t say anything as far as the cost/benefit for mods with paid positions, but additional mods would definitely be useful. There are scam posts that regularly stay up for 12+ hours at a time, people asking for responses to trouble tickets, etc. It’s not a knock on you, you have to sleep some time, people are in different time zones, etc. but I would disagree that there isn’t a need for more mods.

Serotonin — 11/27/2024 7:58 AM
It wouldn’t be the same issue as Danny. The Rolling Grid doesn’t use smooth spot. I haven’t been able to confirm yet if there’s been an issue or not because I haven’t physically seen orders not in the VOB for the Rolling Grid yet
I’ve only been able to see a missing order on one side of the Linear Grid. I’d need to check though and it might be an issue in the calculations of the strat itself in that case.
In other words, it feasibly could make sense why it would do that for the Linear Grid. I can’t see how it would do so with the Rolling Grid though, if that ends up being the case
Oli — 11/27/2024 8:06 AM

And it's cool that its just a view on the regular dex functionality

That would be the master move and so worth it
We could have a dao vote and pay with treasury tokens for it
Or we ask catalyst 😂
Lifeless Ditto — 12/4/2024 7:43 AM
AFAIK catalyst isn't an option anymore, and DAO hasn't been setup yet
Philippe Le Long — 12/4/2024 3:53 PM
Well. there are at least 2 more aggregators. I choose whichever gives the best rates. So if at least one includes axo, it should provide better exchange rates in many cases.
btw,  Vespr wallet also uses Dexhunter for swapping, that's probably even "worse" than TT integrating them.
exkoltibur — 12/4/2024 11:47 PM
Eternl could integrate steelswap if someone asks them. I think the devs are based and not pro-cabal

Directly to Minswap…are you trying to lose your OG status 😆
Market Making is Hard — 12/6/2024 8:42 AM
Yea man, i really like it compared to the rest of the dex aggregators. 
Adamarkets routes to fetch so I think they all came together.
Dev (RWP) — 12/6/2024 9:18 AM
I use an aggregator 90% of the time but if I'm trading something like memecoins I use minswap directly because there's like a 2-3 sometimes 5 minute+ delay between orders posting and when taptools reflects it =/
How do you guys feel about Bodega?
At .07, presale was .1 (but apparently they airdropped unsold allocation so it brings presale price down to like .055 or something) 
Marked Safe From Titan — 12/6/2024 9:28 AM
0.058 public sale now. It's high risk but they say the audit for v2 contracts are about to start. Could be sold passive income to stake there. This still carbonzo tho so will see what fees v2 generates
Dev (RWP) — 12/6/2024 12:43 PM
Yeah I just want to trade it, but seems very risky as only the 1st of their 3 liquidity increases have happened and I dont think the airdrop has occurred yet
So presalers will be up ~30% when the airdrop comes. But they also wont be able to dump in high quantity with this level of slippage.
1.9m fdv seems pretty promising though for the narrative of Cardano's first prediction market

Well is it true wallet charges a fixed percent and DH keeps 90% of that? Or not?

Anytime something is found after audit the auditors should have to pay the money back
dannycemilha — 12/11/2024 8:51 AM
in double
Serotonin — 12/11/2024 8:57 AM
That’s one way to make audits hella more expensive. I mean, I get it, but also that opens up a ton of legal issues, auditors have to get insurance to be able to financially accept the burden if something goes wrong, audits aren’t exhaustive and have a scope so just because there is a bug doesn’t mean it’s not something the auditor didn’t catch it could just be in some part of the code they weren’t paid to audit.
Marked Safe From Titan — 12/11/2024 8:59 AM
I'm talking only what they've audited. U mean they are responsible if something goes wrong with something they audited?
Serotonin — 12/11/2024 9:02 AM
Yea, I’m just saying that there would be constant legal battles over what the scope of the audit was and whose fault it was. And its not like auditors have millions on hand to be able to foot the bill
Marked Safe From Titan — 12/11/2024 9:03 AM
So more reason they're over valued i guess 😅
Serotonin — 12/11/2024 9:03 AM
Also, it opens up a giant hole for scams and insurance fraud. Why would an auditor be liable for tens of millions of dollars to cover someone’s shitty protocol with shitcoins that they claim were worth some amount, but were simply hot air valuations?
So I’ll go out and make some code and intentionally create an obscure hard to find bug that I can then exploit after paperwork was signed by the auditor and I know they’ll foot the cost
Oli — 12/11/2024 9:06 AM
I like how you think 🤔
Marked Safe From Titan — 12/11/2024 9:08 AM
I'm talking only pay back what they charged not cover all losses
But I get what ur saying.
exkoltibur — 12/11/2024 9:20 AM
Audit is just a waste of money. The incentives are not aligned
Auditor may just sit around and do nothing and later sign off
Nobody knows
Serotonin — 12/11/2024 10:40 AM
Ahh yea. Even then there’s still an argument that they did work and even if they caught 99% of bugs should they lose everything because they didn’t catch 100% of them. And there’s still the argument that that money goes to pay their salaries so it’s not like it sits in the bank and they have it in hand to give back, bringing insurance back in as the only alternative
Dev (RWP) — 12/11/2024 10:45 AM
If I remember anastasia did a free audit for them

Lol all the shit Liqwid got for being partially closed source from lenfi influencers and then Lenfi: "we've close sourced for a while"
Marked Safe From Titan — 12/11/2024 11:58 AM
They have to so bad actors don't search for the vulnerability now
I mean liqwid still has back doors to everything so lenfi is right about that. This just shows things can go wrong even if u do the decentralized path
dephi — 12/11/2024 12:32 PM
audits make protocols safu!
Dev (RWP) — 12/11/2024 2:16 PM
Yeah there is a big element of trust there. They use multisig similar to Aave, but the contracts are closed source so no denying that. Except elements relating to staking/voting which are open source. They will open source in time though. Makes no sense to currently imo. Notice it's the Lenfi crowd and Anastasia members who have been the loudest about it though.
Still I'll take the fully doxxed team developing longer than anyone, trying to reasonably protect a competitive advantage over a protocol that has lost tens to hundreds of thousands of user funds and has 90% of their liquidity in a memecoin and their own token.
Dev (RWP) — 12/11/2024 2:26 PM
If snek wasnt using Lenfi to loop loans and do shifty stufd their tvl would probably be like $15m
Marked Safe From Titan — 12/11/2024 2:32 PM
I like the lenfi team. They keep the crypto ethos at heart but it also caused poor mechanics in their design.
Dev (RWP) — 12/11/2024 2:59 PM
I think the crypto ethos can mean a lot of different things to different people. Its core is decentralized control and permission-less access. But both of those exist on a spectrum. For decentralization that means # of nodes, # of core developers, are those developers all one team, multiple teams. What checks and balances do they have. What control over contracts, social media, treasury do they have. The more truly decentralized you become the less quickly you can adapt or react to changes. Maybe the contracts are open source but one team member controlling the twitter could still scam all their users. Or in Lenfi's case, make a twitter post that causes a 40% price decline in 1 hour and cascading liquidations.
If they wanted right now they could close source the code like they did, switch to a new contract, tell people to supply to the new contract and then withdraw all funds by backdooring it.
Dev (RWP) — 12/11/2024 3:07 PM
I've seen their team members talk quite a bit of shit personally and the people in their inner circle are somewhat known bad actors in my book. Bison/dubbleu/conundrum/rami/shillmo and others. Their bread and butter is pump/dump, botting LPs, creating fake hype on twitter while they dump on people, looping snek loans to run up price (no proof of that last one but I'm 90% sure). That and the fact that one of their 2 audits was a freebie that they touted as a badge of security, only for this to happen.
Marked Safe From Titan — 12/11/2024 3:34 PM

This is free marketing. The discussion will go outside of the cardano forum when it gets more concret. I just don't get this total abandonment. Even in an EVM world with infinite competition, would a track record of total neglect on the previous chain, not be a good starting point.
Contrast that with the marketing argument: hello world, we are AXO and our programable, super efficient protocol was trusted to host the entire strategic Cardano stablecoin treasury.

It is , if you feel minswap is doing good volume wise. Its also funding operation from token sale. Plus taptools sc is not OSS, so data is definately cooked. There were evidences of wash trades on minswap for minswap pairs to make volume more.

In a corporate world, nobody accepts mistakes until succesful. You find ways to navigate by blaming here n there. For sure cardano is partly at fault.
